Take a look at Genius' version, [Check The Rhyme](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1VNHp_flJKE), or Vox's, [Rapping, deconstructed: The best rhymers of all time](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QWveXdj6oZU). These videos get millions, and I mean millions of hits online. Why? Well, it's fun! And it's cool. The basic concept is that rap lyrics are \"broken down\" and the rhyming groups are highlighted. Often the videos will do this on a syllable-by-syllable basis, but also sometimes do multi-word rhymes! For this project, we wanted to start simple and focus on single, whole word rhymes.\n\nWe thought we could leverage NLP, a couple of freely available APIs, and some basic React so create a website that generates these kinds of \"highlighted\" rhymes. So what happened?\n\n\n### Usage\n\n\nThe user is presented with one of two options. They may either submit their own bars into a text field, or they can sign into Spotify and have their current song's lyrics analyzed. The lyrics are printed out with the rhyme scheme highlighted.\n\n\n### How it's made\n\n\nWe used a Flask backend to write a couple of endpoints to help us LyricsGenius, an API for scraping lyrics from Genius. We also wrote our NLP-based rhyme detection algorithm in Python and processed all of that data on the backend. Spotify authentication and the UI was all handled by React. We eventually deployed our app to Google Cloud so other users could try it.\n\n\n### Challenges\n\n\nDeveloping the rhyme algorithm was really tricky, especially getting it to be fast enough (eventually down to O(n) time!). We also ran into issues integrating Spotify into our app, but eventually got it sorted.\n\n\n### Accomplishments\n\n\nWe are able to programmatically generate what would take a video editor likely a couple of hours to do! Leveraging modern web technologies and NLP, displaying the rhyme scheme of a song proved to be a challenging but very possible feat.\n\n\n### Future\n\n\nCheck out our [issues](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/RapViz/issues) on GitHub! Though it was built at a hackathon (and there's quite a bit of spaghetti code) this is definitely a project I want to continue developing in the future."

The individual who defaulted is tasked with rebuilding their credit score, and the issuer is laden with the debt. Ideally, a financial institution could _predict_ whether or not someone will default ahead of time, and prevent it from happening in the first place.\n\nWhile this is a daunting task—and one that requires sensitivity given the fact we are dealing with people's financial livelihoods—this is a situation where machine learning can be of use.\n\n\n### Question\n\n\nWe'll apply machine learning techniques to answer the following question.\n\n> Will this person default next month on their credit card payment?\n\nWith data relating to that person's demographics, payment history, and other financial information, we can attempt to predict the answer to this question.\n\n\n### Data\n\n\nThe data set we used is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In contains demographic information such as sex, education, marriage and age; information regarding and individual's finances including limit balance, repayment status, bill amounts, and payment amounts. Finally, it contains whether or not that individual really _did_ default next month.\n\nThis is simply a high-level description of the data; for a more in-depth view, consult Kaggle or our [full report](https://www.notion.so/michaelfromyeg/hw6.pdf).\n\n\n## Exploration\n\n\nBefore we delve into our analysis, let's get a better sense of the data available.\n\nTo begin with, we portioned off a chunk of our data, namely 25%, to eventually assess our model's effectiveness after our model is already created. Let's explore the remnants.\n\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis (\"EDA\")\n\n\nWe have 225,000 rows in our data available for training use, each representing an individual and their associated \"features\" (such as age or sex) as outlined above.\n\nThe \"average\" demographic in this data is someone who's single (instead of married), has a university-level education, and an age of about 35.\n\nThe individual with the highest limit balance is a 47 year old female with precisely NT$1,000,000 available, equivalent to roughly USD$100,000. This is definitely an outlier; the distribution for the rest of the balances is shown below. (Note dollar amounts are in New Taiwan dollars.)\n\nWe find most balances in the range of NT$50,000 (~USD$6,500) to NT$100,000 (~USD$13,000) which seems reasonable.\n\n![distribution-of-payamt2.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/001-distribution-of-payamt2.webp)\n\n![distribution-of-limitbal.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/002-distribution-of-limitbal.webp)\n\n![distribution-of-classes.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/003-distribution-of-classes.webp)\n\nThe repayment statuses in the month of August 2005 are, for whatever reason, highly skewed towards 0, which is the encoding of \"use of revolving credit.\" A visualization of this is shown below.\n\nIt might be interesting to investigate any geopolitical events that occurred in the same time frame of this data set, the summer and fall of 2005, to account for any global financial trends.\n\nWith a better understanding of the data at hand, we proceed to our analysis.\n\n\n## Analysis\n\n\nBelow is a description of our final model, and the results it yielded.\n\n\n### Model\n\n\nFor our final model we opted to use [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which is a gradient boosted tree based model. Gradient boosted models are ensembles of weaker prediction models, in our case, decision trees.\n\nLightGBM greatly outperformed the Decision Tree model. It also consistently outperformed the Random Forest model, even after we performed feature selection using `RFECV` and hyperparameter optimization using random search.\n\n\n### Results\n\n\nThe LightGBM model achieved an accuracy of 0.82, F1-score of 0.48, and recall of 0.38. This means that from our test data, we would correctly predict whether or not someone would default about 82% of the time. Among all of the examples of \"did default,\" we're correct only 38% of the time (—given the imbalance in the data set, this is somewhat to be expected). These results are promising, and should generalize well on \"deployment data\" since the test and validation scores are similar.\n\nIt's also interesting to look at how important our features were in the LightGBM model. SHAP force plots are one way of achieving this; without diving into depth here, just know that \"red\" means \"did not default,\" and a bigger arrow implies more impact.\n\nIn the two plots above, we see that PAY1 played a major role. Perhaps this is because if an individual gets off on the wrong foot, they are unlikely to ever recover. Banks might be incentivized to try to get on top of late payments immediately, to prevent financial hardships from spiraling into an eventual default!\n\n![shap-force2.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/004-shap-force2.webp)\n\n![shap-force1.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/005-shap-force1.webp)\n\n\n## Reflection\n\n\nWhile we are satisfied with our results, there are some caveats that should be made known before anyone attempts to use this model on \"real world\" use-cases.\n\nFirstly, the given data suffers from class imbalance. Most of our examples were of type \"did not default,\" at a ratio of nearly 3-to-1. The imbalance in our data was naturally occurring, so we asked ourselves what kind of error we were trying to minimize. We were concerned with minimizing false negatives, and so we chose to focus on recall as our evaluation metric. Sometimes naturally occurring class imbalance is okay to ignore. However, we believe that a possible improvement of our modeling could be to undersample or oversample the data to attempt to further address class imbalance.\n\nSecondly, the data available here was highly localized. All of our examples were from Taiwan, and so it is likely that our modeling would not generalize well to anywhere else in the world. Applying this model as a US Bank, for example, would be inappropriate as different cultures may exhibit different financial habits.\n\nFinally, there may have been overfitting on the hyperparameters. The final model described here was not our only attempt at this problem; rather, it was just our best attempt. Since we re-tested with various models and ran our hyperparameter tuning more than once it is _possible_ that we unintentionally overfit our model.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nFrom our data set, we were able to produce a LightGBM model that showed promising results, with a recall score of 0.38. In the future, we could look to further tune our LightGBM attempt to improve on our performance!\n\nThanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed it."

Source code available [here](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/groUber).\n\ngroUber is aimed to help event planners create carpools and was built for To the Moon and Hack, [an MLH event](https://mlh.io/). (If you're going to use this project to plan your event, remember to stay 6ft apart!)\n\n\n### Motivation\n\n\nThis project was built by a group of 5 students from UBC in Vancouver, BC who love automating things. And one horrific task all of us have run into when planning our events is creating a workable carpool schedule.\n\nIt's a great option for getting your group together: whether it be parents figuring out how best to get their kids to soccer practice, or friends accommodating those without access to a car, carpooling is common, but creating a plan can be painful, to say the least.\n\nYou finally come up with a workable schedule: everyone can make it to the event, no driver has to go in annoying, wasteful loops, and everything can start on time.\n\nThen a driver with 4 seats drops out. And you have to do it all over again. No, thanks.\n\n\n### Introducing: groUber\n\n\nWith groUber, never go through that headache again. As an event organizer, create your event, send an invite link to your friends, and create a carpool schedule with one click. As a participant, simply receive a link, RSVP, and inform the organizer of how many seats you have available. You'll receive a schedule on the day-of.\n\nUsing the Radar API and the Google Maps API, along with a bit of algo-magic, our app will create the most optimal carpool schedule for everyone involved. We were hesitant to do this project at first; the idea of designing an algorithm to find the \"best\" carpool strategy was intimidating to say the least. After some research, it turns out this is actually classified an NP-hard problem. We didn't need to solve the problem generally though, and were able to design a heuristic algorithm to be able to compute this with fairly good results. Here are a few examples of scholarly work in this area. It took great teamwork, persistence, and a decent amount of caffeine to get this working.\n\nNow, drivers won't have to waste gas, and everyone will get there on time. Someone drops out? No problem, our app will allow you to adjust your schedule, painlessly.\n\ngroUber is ride-sharing for your group of friends, without all the expenses and overhead. Do a favor for the environment, and for your stress-levels, and start using groUber today.\n\nHere's our [whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSLo8DhZ7p-VgPnmieasD01zZ2_76uMxPxSwVErq3_gQPvpokrFI4G5SHA1Pxrc9b9ouhK5yvL-4X3t/pub) where you can find a more in-depth justification for this hack!

Sign-up using your Google account.\n\nCreate your event with all key details, and send an invite to your to-be attendees. Once they RSVP, you'll see their details on your event dashboard. Then, generate your event's carpool schedule in one click!\n\nParticipants must submit their address, if they're driving, and if so, how many seats they have available in their vehicle.\n\nCheck out some screenshots of the application below!\n\n![grouber.png](/blog-images/grouber/001-grouber.webp)\n\n![homescreen.png](/blog-images/grouber/002-homescreen.webp)\n\n![RSVPPage.jpg](/blog-images/grouber/003-RSVPPage.webp)\n\n![appMap.jpg](/blog-images/grouber/004-appMap.webp)\n\n![branding.png](/blog-images/grouber/005-branding.webp)\n\n![dashboard.jpg](/blog-images/grouber/006-dashboard.webp)\n\n\n### Contributing\n\n\nCheck out the GitHub repository for more information."

      "content": "In my first year of high school, I had the luxury of spending an all-inclusive weekend in Lacombe, Alberta. In case you’re not familiar, Lacombe is a city in central Alberta, 125 kilometers south of Edmonton and home of the Len Thompson Manufacturing Plant (that part, of course, you already knew). In 2017, it was home to the Alberta Student Leadership Conference. The website is still up, [here](https://connectedleaders.weebly.com/).\n\n![A poster from the conference. 800 student leaders!](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/000-image.webp)\n\nI went, starry eyed, to learn how to lead. And learn I did! (My whole leadership experience in high school would be a blog post on its own.) I attended countless workshops, keynotes, and lunches. And what did I get at each of them? (Besides, you know, leadership skills.) Paper. In some form or another: pamphlets, brochures, photos, postcards, name tags, bookmarks. You name it, I got one.\n\nComing home, I was faced with a serious dilemma. How was I going to possibly save all of this essential learning material? My printed-out-Polaroids? Or further still, my conference badge?! My mother (as always) had the solution. \n\nThe Hilroy Studio® Scrap Book.\n\n![The scrap book, in all its glory.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/001-big_HLR26411.webp)\n\nThis series of twenty manila pages, coil-bound and enveloped in a firm blue cover has served as the springboard for a decade of creative cataloging. My now fourteen-book long series is a living memoir that has served as a window into my past (translated into two-dimensional form). A collection featuring romantic letters and nasty break-ups, acceptance letters and untimely rejections, postcards from around the planet and receipts from my local liquor store. It’s got everything.\n\nAfter occupying a corner of my bedroom for the past year, I recently sent them home to Edmonton (as I moved to San Francisco, to begin New Grad Life). I packed them up and shipped them off to the Great White North. However, while on a mini graduation trip in Tofino, British Columbia, my mom remarked that while one of the two boxes I sent home had arrived, the other was nowhere to be found. And of course, the missing box was the one with the scrapbooks.\n\nFor a short time, I was devastated. An entire decade of hand-picked, cherished collectibles had ostensibly been whisked away. Up until that point, I had never bothered to reflect on how much the cathartic cutting-and-pasting meant to me. It was just a sort-of offbeat hobby, a way to make sense of all the random Things that showed up in my pockets in my day-to-day life.\n\nThankfully, the scrapbooks did turn up only a handful of days later. The near-miss pushed me to think about how much this hobby had taught me about myself. And now, on the roughly ten year anniversary of the hobby, it’s time to finally share those reflections, and some of my favourite pages from along the way.\n\nFirst, I should share my Rules of The Scrap. \n\n1. Err on the side of keeping it\n\t1. Leaving a table at a restaurant? Scoop up the receipt. Have some miscellaneous paper in your pockets after a night out? Save it. Dump it all in a bin for later processing. I often find the most insignificant pieces (e.g., a receipt), to serve as the best starting point for a story (e.g., “remember how laughably bad the service was?”).\n2. Make it real, not ‘nice’\n\t1. Let’s be honest: life is often ugly and occasionally beautiful, and my scrapbook reflects that. ‘Scrap’ means discarded, leftovers—not fancy gel pens and cursive writing. It’s not Instagram-ified (i.e., limited to the top 1% of all my best memories), but rather a depiction of my whole self.\n3. The opening is dedicated to travel, and the last to former-selves\n\t1. Travel makes life long and special, so for me it appears first-and-foremost—boarding passes, bus tickets, luggage tags, and more adorn the opening page.\n\t2. I also _usually_ dedicate the last page to pieces of ID I no longer use, as a kind of goodbye to a phase of life.\n\nExpanding on 3(b), here is, for example, the last page of scrapbook #9, featuring Michael the Singaporean Exchange Student.\n\nFeaturing my ‘Tembusu Privilege Card’ (though after being a guest [there](https://tembusu.nus.edu.sg/), the real privilege was mine), my Cardiflex (which, like any card for a printer, never worked), my bus pass, debit cards from the world’s most annoying bank, my student ID, and my foreign ID (featuring a rather rough passport photo taken after a nearly 20 hour flight).\n\nAll once mainstays in my wallet, now at rest in scrapbook #9.\n\n![The ID cards of scrapbook #9.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/002-image.webp)\n\nI’ll amass content over about a one to three month period, and then spend an afternoon sorting the content. I rip out the interesting bits and pieces, and paste them in haphazardly. (Usually I’ll toss on a movie in the background. Since you got here, [you should follow me on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/michaelfromyeg/)!)\n\nFor me, the activity of making the scrap books is as significant as the scrap books themselves. (Forgive me, but I'm going to be a bit philosophical here.) We Humans (—capital ‘H’) toil away on the ol' Blue Marble. Purpose is something which we actively breathe into life. Those things which I scrap book—remnants from events, letters from relationships, receipts from dinners, and raffle tickets from the nights out—are, for me, little microcosms of our Purpose (—capital ‘P’) here. Life must be lived! Piecing together the scrap books makes me appreciate the insanity and innate wonder of our existence here—all The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.\n\nSoapboxing aside—here are some of my favorite pages from each, with some stories.\n\n![Scrapbook #12. From my trip to Vietnam, circa April 2023.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/003-image.webp)\n\n\n**Scrapbook #12**\n\nThe Ha Giang loop is probably some of the best travel you can do today. This is the route I took on the three day trip through north Vietnam.\n\nThe loop is so much more than getting on a motorbike and pressing the gas. It's the mishmash of people, the party, and the drivers themselves.\n\nHell, my driver (Thanh, pronounced 'Tyne,' which, to my amusement, is the real name of one of my other good friends) at just merely 26 years of age had four children. He had an inkling for YouTube trap-house mash-ups, and was astounded that a thing such as a [Big Booty Mix 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm3bt4Q39b8) exists.\n\n\n**Scrapbook #1**\n\nThere have been very few times I've written in, or allowed writing in the scrap books. One exception was my last day of high school. These people all mean a lot to me, despite the fact that I've seen a whopping ~4 of them consistently over the past 5 or so years.\n\nLife moves fast; this page is a grounding reminder that the people in your circle can change immediately, without warning. A reminder to call your friends and let them know they’re loved, however you express that. \n\n(Also, we should take a moment appreciate the absurdity in the top middle of the page, and the purported run for Prime Minister implied by 'Michael DeMarco 2020!!' in the bottom right—I'll take the votes.)\n\nOne more here: the 'Sorry Joey did you like that' was from prom. My best friend in high school, Jordan, and I campaigned for Best Bromance. In his best Steve Harvey impression, my friend announced it was uh—oh—I misread the names—and just like that we lost. Can't win them all!\n\n![Scrapbook #1.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/004-image.webp)\n\n![Scrapbook #6.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/005-image.webp)\n\n\n**Scrapbook #6**\n\nMe, as a game of Wordle. If you had to guess where this was used, what would you go for first? Maybe a residence hall event? Perhaps some other club social?\n\nHow about a fraternity party?\n\nTwice annually, I had the privilege of getting to decorate my room in some absurd theme courtesy of Phi Gamma Delta a.k.a. Fiji's 'Small Rooms' function. In the spring of 2021, Wordle was all the rage, and thus my friend Jacob and I Wordle-ified his room. I actually created a custom version of Wordle for our room ('Fijidle'), which eventually got DMCA'd by the New York Times for copyright infringement. [Yeah](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/13/1238142507/cease-desist-new-york-times-wordle-spin-offs).\n\n\n**Scrapbook #14**\n\nLast but not least, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout-out to the Coffee News. This is—seriously—one of the things I miss most from Alberta. It's a two-page spread featuring four off-the-wall or otherwise 'neat' news stories, quotes, a bit of trivia, Horoscopes, jokes, and a game to search for a drawing of a little man among the ad space.\n\nI guess my mom picked up on how much I enjoy the weekly editions, so has now begun stockpiling them, and mailing them out to wherever I happen to be on a monthly cadence. Thanks, mom.\n\n![Scrapbook #14.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/006-image.webp)\n\n\n---\n\nThose are just a few cherry-picked highlights, but there's of course much more story to tell. So where do I go from here? \n\nI’m tinkering with ways for friends to join on the story. I want to create something like a series of [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) boards with collaborative \"sticky-noting\" of things that stick out to people. I do need to redact some of the content that’s a bit _too_ personal, but I think there's a cool, collaborative happy medium here.\n\nIdeas? Questions? Concerns? For the first two, feel free to write me at michaelfromyeg [at] gmail [dot] com; for the third, I'm not quite sure I care, so don't."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on October 29th, 2023.\n\nStory time. I'm bad at flying.\n\nBut I don't mean the act of flying, as a pilot. I mean as a passenger.\n\nHow can you be bad at packing your bags, going to the airport, filing through security, and hopping on a plane? Great question! I'm not sure, but after reading this, I think you'll be inclined to agree.\n\nRight now, I'm sitting in the Victoria airport after trying to board a short-haul flight to my hometown of Edmonton, having it cancelled and rebooked (instead through a three-way connection from Vancouver-Victoria-Calgary-Edmonton), then _illegally_ boarding my first flight with an expired license, only to get flagged in Victoria. That's right. I'm now stranded in YYJ all because I wanted to watch some Heritage Classic hockey. And for turning 22.\n\n![My four boarding passes, in all their glory.](/blog-images/im-bad-at-flying/000-boarding-passes.webp)\n\nThis morning was hell from start to finish. I woke up with a blistering hangover at the crack of dawn. The past night I'd spent Hall-o-weekend-ing and was now going to head to Edmonton to catch the Heritage Classic. It was the Battle of Alberta, and the first outdoor game in Edmonton in 20+ years. I convinced my whole family to go. I was elated! Upon arriving at the airport, however, I saw my flight was cancelled. I waited in a brutally long line of folks getting other flights sorted (including, but not limited to, some aspirant vacationers pleading to make it to Puerto Vallarta and a few Calgarians who faced a different, but similar cancellation—in that case, WestJet's probably doing them a favor by keeping them in Vancouver). It was only while waiting in this roughly hour-long line that I began to really feel the effects of running a half-marathon and clubbing the day prior. I was seething in pain, literally clutching one of the hand rails just desperate to take a nap on _some_ plane going somewhere.\n\nI finally got to the front, and the gate agent was friendly and understanding. \"You going to the game?\" I gave him a nod and he gave me one of the most ridiculous itineraries I've ever seen in return. First to Victoria, then to Calgary, _then_ to Edmonton, just in time for the 5pm puck drop. I had 20 minutes to make it to the gate, so I flew through security (with a bit of WestJet-endorsed line-cutting) and made it no problem. I boarded my flight with ease and had a smooth trip. What else could go wrong!\n\nLots. My connection from Victoria to Calgary got delayed, but not so much that I would miss my Edmonton connection. Annoying, but not an ordeal. I paid for a $22 breakfast sandwich, and finally started to fight off the hangover. I went to board the flight around 11am and the gate agent stopped me dead in my tracks. My license is expired?! There's no way! I _just_ **flew** here.\n\nI turned 22 on October 15th, 2023, and indeed, that's the day my license expired. Mind you I had bought alcohol, been to the club, and _boarded an aircraft_ with this identification. If I had had another piece of non-photo identification, I might've been able to board, but my other documents were with my passport at home. Boohoo. Back to Vancouver I go! Sheepishly, I messaged my family and transferred my mom the ticket.\n\nThis is where it gets better. When the gate agent told me I couldn't go, I wasn't that phased. **This isn't the first time my license has gotten me into plane-boarding trouble.**\n\n![Jasper, Alberta, Canada circa January 2021.](/blog-images/im-bad-at-flying/001-jasper.webp)\n\nStory time, again. Back in high school, I didn't get my license. So, during the summer after my freshman year, I did lessons with the Alberta Motor Association and was geared up for the exam. The only problem was the pandemic put a pause on the actual examinations. I had to write it in December, instead, when I was home for winter break.\n\nNo problem, I figured. I took the exam on the second last day of my trip home and passed with ease. I headed into the DMV to process the paperwork, and coincidentally was wearing my UBC hoodie. The DMV agent smartly asked if I'd need my license to fly back to Vancouver. After some discussion, we (that is, myself, the agent, and my mother, a.k.a., _my_ agent) agreed that the temporary one was fine. Why?!? I had no idea! That obviously makes no sense. But we all agreed.\n\nSo, when I got to the airport, I obviously wasn't let on. However, I needed to be back in Vancouver as soon as physically possible. I was scheduled to start my first-ever co-op gig with Samsung. I looked at flights and… $#!T! Everything was unbelievably expensive or booked out.\n\nI explored all other options. Bussing? No dice. How about… a train? The VIA Rail economy ticket wasn't too expensive (~$150 if I recall correctly). Done. Booked.\n\nAnd with that, I rode The Canadian from Edmonton to Vancouver in early January. The trip itself was stunning, with unbelievably gorgeous views of the Western Canada in wintertime. It was a bit eerie though, as the crowd on the train looked very no-fly-list-y. One dude in got kicked off in Northern British Columbia for using drugs in the washroom.\n\nThe other train ordeal was a massive blizzard that passed through the interior during the train travel. It knocked down a litany of trees, all over the tracks. This meant we would ride for twenty or thirty minutes, stop, clear the tracks, and go again. In the middle of nowhere! My mom had packed me peanut butter sandwiches for the train trip, and I had to start _rationing_ them. I killed time by trying to write unit tests for APK file extraction (…I was on the Knox team at Samsung). Not the most riveting stuff, I'll confess. Eventually, after nearly a complete **twenty-four-hour** delay, I made it back to Vancouver.\n\nYou would've thought that experience had taught me to carry my godforsaken passport, but evidently my hungover morning self was not exactly envisioning this exact scenario.\n\nFool me once, fool me twice. [And I'll probably make a fool of myself again](https://youtube.com/watch?v=aqGn-1XX7cI)."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on August 23rd, 2022.\n\nIt's been about two weeks since I wrapped up my position as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern at Amazon, and I wanted to reflect on my time there this summer. I often get asked about the full end-to-end experience of my time at Amazon, so before I get into what I worked on and what I learned, I'll first do a full re-wind to my initial application.\n\n\n## Working towards a FAANG offer\n\n\nIn recruiting for my third co-op term at UBC, I laid out definitive guidelines for the kind of position I was after. My primary objective was to work at a company solving complex, 'technically engaging' problems, to grow quickly as an early-career engineer. In addition to at-work complexity, I was also very interested in moving to a new city in Canada or the US, to grow personally and get a chance to travel to new places.\n\nI applied to Amazon in early August as soon as their applications opened. (For those of you currently recruiting, this is often an overlooked but highly important factor; big companies often recruit on a \"rolling-basis,\" meaning an early application is critical.) I chose Toronto largely on a whim.\n\n![The e-mail inviting me to interview at Amazon.](/blog-images/day-one-my-internship-at-amazon/000-amazon-interview-invitation.webp)\n\nI then completed two online assessments (OAs). The first was a fairly standard set of technical questions on HackerRank, and the second was a \"work simulation\" to assess behavioural skills asynchronously. I fortunately passed, and then scheduled a final-round 45-minute technical interview. The interview was also fairly standard; it consisted of technical and behavioural questions. Unique to Amazon, the behaviourals are focused on a set of [leadership principles](https://amazon.jobs/en/principles) (LPs) that, I can now attest, are embedded throughout company culture. I'll touch more on the LPs later.\n\n\n## Getting settled in Toronto\n\n\nMoving to Toronto was a rather involved experience. Immediately after wrapping up one of my most brutal final exam schedules to date, I had to pack, donate, or dump my items from BC that I had nested during the pandemic. (It was... a lot of stuff.) Then I was busy with Amazon's pre-onboarding while also recruiting for Fall 2022 internships. (That's a whole [other story](https://michaeldemar.co/blog/rescind-playbook).)\n\n![My final exam schedule. Back-to-back networking, databases, and operating systems was not fun.](/blog-images/day-one-my-internship-at-amazon/001-b0a06e05-cccb-441b-b1f0-abf023437428.webp)\n\n![Leo, my pet Russian tortoise, also had to be sent home to stay with my parents.](/blog-images/day-one-my-internship-at-amazon/002-leo.webp)\n\nI boarded my flight and was off to Toronto. As an Edmonton native, Toronto was rather overwhelming. The city is gigantic and there is always something bustling. It truly is a \"concrete jungle,\" especially when you're working in the heart of downtown, situated right between the CN Tower and Scotiabank Arena.\n\nThankfully, I was able to take full advantage of what the city has to offer. And with weekend trips to Montreal, Niagara, and Muskoka, there was no shortage of nearby entertainment throughout my three-and-a-half months in the city.\n\n\n## From big tech to Bigger tech\n\n\nThe next major adjustment for me came in navigating life at a huge company. Make no mistake: Samsung, where I previously interned, is also large. However, there is something truly unique about \"Amazon-scale.\" When your intern class is nearly 15,000 folks, things will assuredly feel a bit different.\n\nThankfully, I had an awesome team and intern class around me to support me throughout the onboarding process. Amazon's onboarding, while extensive, is also exhaustive, leaving you with a full set of tools and knowledge to thrive in your time there. My initial nerves were replaced by excitement, and I dove head-first into our tech stack.\n\nI got onboarded to my project relatively quickly. Within the Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) organization, I had the chance to work on a \"product tour.\" (Here's [an article](https://blog.asana.com/2018/10/move-fast-without-technical-debt-product-tours-react) from a former Asana intern about an analogous project for their core application.) It was built on top of a complex, multipage booking portal that used React. While I didn't anticipate being placed on a frontend project, I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would, and I learned a ton about today's challenges in scaling modern frontend technologies. (I'm even following this experience up by giving a React workshop at this year's [Hack The North](https://hackthenorth.com/) in Waterloo—make sure to tune in.)\n\n![My desk!](/blog-images/day-one-my-internship-at-amazon/003-amazon-desk.webp)\n\n\n## Six lessons from the six\n\n\nIt was rare I had a day at work without some new learning or takeaway. Here are six of my highlights.\n\n\n### Lesson #1: There are no bad questions\n\n\nWhile I had a decent chunk of relevant React experience to leverage for my project, our application was still complex and tens of thousands of lines of code long. To navigate the tricky waters that come with being an intern in engineering, questions are your lifeline. I was able to on-board to our project right away by scheduling impactful one-on-ones and remaining curious about our project's anatomy.\n\nPersonally, my Achilles' heel as an engineer is getting bogged down by particularly challenging problems (and there are no shortage of those at Amazon). Asking questions turned out to be a fantastic shortcut for getting to the heart of an issue.\n\n\n### Lesson #2: Complexity is evil\n\n\nThere is one special question you can ask: \"why?\" Asking the right \"why?\" can help determine what exactly is desired by your end-user (or \"customer,\" in Amazon terms) and minimize feature bloat. In particular, I had chats with PMs from separate teams (...in entirely different continents), so finding cohesion in product vision and preventing unneeded complexity required careful question-asking.\n\n(As any good [Grug-brain developer](https://grugbrain.dev/) knows, complexity is an existential threat, so it should be eliminated at all costs!)\n\n\n### Lesson #3: Agility is your friend\n\n\nSomething interesting about the project I worked on was that it was actually a continuation of a former intern project. Often, Amazon interns complete a design phase for their project, scoping out the minimum viable feature set for an initial release before jumping into implementation.\n\nFrom nearly my first day, I was working on delivering an already-scoped design. I love getting hands-on, but quickly found myself in a cobweb of only partially ready code. I didn't take enough time to understand and revise the existing timeline, which left me trying to ship many features at once.\nThis led to large code changes that were difficult to test and debug.\n\nInstead, try to be as lean as possible in your code. Small commits, small pull requests, and minimally scoped changes make it easy to bisect changes when things, inevitably, go wrong. Also: any refactoring work must be completed prior to shipping new features.\n\n\n### Lesson #4: Community is key\n\n\nIt takes a village to raise a child, and it also takes a village to raise an intern. It's critical to develop open communication lines between yourself and your \"support network\" on the job. At Amazon, this consisted of my mentor, manager, my manager's manager, and the most senior engineer on my team. Scheduling regular one-on-ones and documenting the discussions levelled up my experience tremendously.\n\nThe idea of community goes beyond your team as well. It's also essential to immerse yourself in activities with your fellow interns and the broader city you live in as well.\n\n\n### Lesson #5: Culture isn't just buzzwords\n\n\nAmazon's leadership principles (LPs) are embedded into the DNA of the company. My co-workers would constantly leverage the LPs to guide hard decisions or steer meetings in the right direction. Beyond being the backbone of Amazon's culture, the LPs are also just brimmed with great life advice. As a former leadership student in high school, I had a lot of fun trying to embed ideas like \"Ownership,\" \"Invent and Simplify\" and \"Learn and Be Curious\" into my day-to-day at Amazon.\n\n\n### Lesson #6: Have fun\n\n\nIt's easy to get wrapped up in work and find yourself constantly worrying about return offers, your next internship, and the various other stressors of everyday life. Kick back with your co-workers when the chance arises and make the most of your internship. To help center myself, I would often reflect on where I came from to end up at Amazon. This kind of mindfulness exercise helped me make the most of my time at Amazon.\n\n\n## So... what's next?\n\n\nWhile I could not be more grateful for my time at Amazon, I also could not be more excited for what this next year has in store. I have a chance this August to rest and reconnect with family before I join Tesla this fall on the Supercharging team. I'll also be serving as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) for my first-ever 300-level course; namely, \"Internet Computing\" (CPSC 317) at UBC with Professor Alan Wagner.\n\nQuestions?

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on July 17th, 2022.\n\nThis upcoming fall, I was set on making a number of fairly major life changes. Firstly, I was about to move from one of the world's largest technology companies to a cryptocurrency start-up. Secondly, I was going to pack my bags and move from Canada to Palo Alto, California. And thirdly, I was going to do it all basically on my own.\n\nAs of Thursday, I've been thrown back to square zero. Due to pressures in the cryptocurrency space, coined (pun-intended) a \"crypto winter\" (though frankly it seems pretty sunny in Toronto these days...), my offer at [BitGo](https://bitgo.com/) was rescinded.\n\n![The e-mail from BitGo.](/blog-images/the-rescinded-internship-offer-playbook/000-email.webp)\n\nTo be totally candid, I had kind of seen this coming. There were a number of major shake-ups with the early talent team that had recruited me in the first place, and I'd already seen the likes of Coinbase and Shopify pull similar moves. It's an unfortunate reality of working in an emerging industry, and I was aware of the risk in accepting the role. I'm still as passionate as ever about the potential of web3, and I know it won't be long until I'm back.\n\n![Shopify pulls internships.](/blog-images/the-rescinded-internship-offer-playbook/001-shopify.webp)\n\nI'm keeping my chin-up and have my focus fixed firmly on getting back to square one. In this post, I want to share my \"game plan\" for how I'm going to strive to achieve just that. It's essentially the advice I would give myself if I could go back two years and coach my freshman-self through a first round of internship applications. Hope you enjoy.\n\n\n## 1. Use your network\n\n\nThis piece is especially important when you're just getting started with recruiting in tech, or when you've faced a bit of a setback. To use a cliché, \"your network is your net worth!\" I find computer science doesn't have the same culture around recruiting, coffee chats, etc., as other industries, but it can truly accelerate your career.\n\nUse social media to be open about projects you're working on and roles you're looking for. Keep your profiles up-to-date and try to stay somewhat active throughout the year. I think everyone feels a bit of anxiety around posting on LinkedIn, but that's easily one of the most effective channels. I've had 25,000+ impressions on my latest post. \"Tech Twitter\" is also a great place to stay active; I often find early-stage founders recruit directly from the site. Relying on visible, open job applications like Indeed or LinkedIn is merely the tip of iceberg of what's out there!\n\n(Another more \"bold\" strategy is becoming a content creator YouTube. I've met a ton of cool people after posting [this](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9FP8esDPPKY) video on advice for getting into the computer science major at UBC. To this day, I continue to get emails and DMs from students all across the globe!)\n\nAlso, go to stuff! I love using apps like Eventbrite and Meetup to see what's happening in my area. Attending events is bar-none the best way to meet people; networking \"online\" is not nearly as effective as just bumping into strangers at a conference. Try to step out of your comfort zone and put yourself out there. You'd be surprised what can turn up!\n\n\n## 2. Don't be shy\n\n\nWhen it comes to recruiting, you simply cannot afford to be shy. It's akin to that hackneyed quote, \"shoot for the moon, and you're destined to land in the stars.\" Any ounce of impostor syndrome will hold you back from sending that one key cold email, or submitting an application to that one key role. After all, given the sheer size and rapid growth of the technology industry, it has been and continues to be a \"numbers game.\" Finding a job you love takes a fair amount of dedication, and obliges casting a wide net.\n\nI want to add a caveat here as well. This piece of advice I did not follow _at all_ last summer, and I got extremely lucky to end up at Amazon. I applied to a minimal set of jobs, and instead was bailed out by Greylock and a few \"LeetCode easy's.\" Amazon is a fantastic company, and I am extremely fortunate to be where I am, but without casting a wide net, you'll be left with a lingering \"what if?\" Always try to aim higher; contentment will limit you!\n\nA good way to apply this right away is to cold email your dream companies. For example, I've always wanted to work in the NLP space, and a dream company of mine is [Voiceflow](https://voiceflow.com/). I sent a brief, direct email to the founder, and I heard back! While it didn't lead to a job, I came pretty darn close to a dream role. All from email!\n\n![An e-mail to Braden Ream, the CEO of Voiceflow.](/blog-images/the-rescinded-internship-offer-playbook/002-voiceflow.webp)\n\nThis time around, I am working diligently and systematically to exhaust all possible avenues. Persistence pays dividends in the long run.\n\n\n## 3. Gratitude in all things\n\n\nIn relying on your network's support and applying just about... everywhere, you must lead with gratitude. It is vital to show thanks for those that support you along every step of the journey. I would not be at my current university or in my current job if it weren't for the support of my family, a host of invaluable mentors, and a number of friends over the years encouraging me to keep pushing. It's essential to take time to show thanks; it's the right thing to do!\n\nThat being said, it's often overlooked. In the hustle and bustle of trying to get a job, it is easy to forget the follow-up thanks. Leading with gratitude is key.\n\nHere's an easy way to apply gratitude right away. _Always_ follow up after chats and interviews. Sending a thank-you email is a must-do in my book, and can help you stand out. You can try kick-starting relationships with past mentors as well. It is never too late to rekindle and say thanks.\n\n\n## 4. Builders build\n\n\nIf I could only pick one rule to keep, it'd be this one. The beauty of computer science is that no one can stop you from building. Like really, no one. (OK... maybe like, the FBI. But that's about it.)\n\nLeft without a job, there are countless ways to upskill and get ready for the next round. My favorite is building out 'little apps' (though a fully-fledged start-up is great, too). Participating in hackathons is a great way to get this going. Ask your friends and family what kinds of problems there having, and make little hacks for them. Keep them accessible for others online, and do it [in public](https://swyx.io/learn-in-public). Another good trick for easy adoption is building products for other developers; some good examples are CLI tools and IDE extensions.\n\nThe best experience I had with this was in Summer 2020 participating in an ex-Uber engineer-led program called [\"Summer of Shipping\"](https://summerofshipping.com/). It was an awesome community to helped folks bounce back from a summer with a _ton_ of offers rescinded. I even worked at a start-up idea [weNote](https://wenote.ca/) that I'm hoping to return to this upcoming year!\n\n![My landing page for weNote.](/blog-images/the-rescinded-internship-offer-playbook/003-wenote.webp)\n\nThere's also tons of resources online where you can learn for free, if you need a break from purely creating.\n\nJust remember: the beauty of software is that truly anyone where anywhere can get started today. So don't wait for a FAANG offer to get started; start building today.\n\n\n## In parting\n\n\nThose are the 4 rules that I'll be following while re-recruiting for the fall. Have any you would add? Feel free to give me a shout at [mdemar01@student.ubc.ca](mailto:mdemar01@student.ubc.ca). I'm always happy to chat."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on July 3rd, 2022.\n\nEvery single day, you start out as an empty cup.\n\nHumbling, right?\n\nBeyond your laundry list of personal to-dos, slog of tasks at work, and mountain of messages to which you need to respond, you actually need to focus on just one thing each day. And that's filling your cup.\n\n\n## The inspiration\n\n\nI came across an idea loosely linked to this end product from YouTuber [Ali Abdaal](https://youtube.com/c/aliabdaal). His rather simple, but genius suggestion was to mark a highlight each and every day of your life. \"Mark\" can look differently depending on your routine; my weapon of choice is inscribing an \"H\" beside an item from my bullet journal. In some way, though, you should be tracking your highlights for easy reflection.\n\nHaving a \"highlight\" each day doesn't mean spending every day at a concert, or a sports game, or at the hottest club. Rather, it's something that brings you a bit of needed warmth when life's natural chaos ensues. It can be as simple as a great meal, a brisk walk, or a quick phone call. They're moments that you'd want to capture and put in jar for safe-keeping, but often a quick photo will have to do.\n\n\n## The idea\n\n\nAnd those highlight moments help \"fill your cup.\" (The \"highlight\" idea for me is a bit plain, but I think a visual analogy gets it across better. Maybe that's my inner-teacher speaking.)\n\nNot all cups are created equally, either. After a particularly stressful day or week, I find my cup becomes more of a vat. Other times, I'm a bit more of a teaspoon. Being aware of this ebb and flow though has proven to be a particularly powerful idea when it comes to managing my mental health.\n\nWith the pandemic, we had a bit of a drought. It was hard to stumble across cup-filling-moments, so to speak, and I did not effort to create them when they were most needed. On an empty cup, it's hard to be yourself. Not just in terms of the capitalist-fuelled \"can I reach _Inbox Zero_?\" sense, but spiritually, just 'being' yourself.\n\n\n## A year half-full\n\n\nAnd since we've reached the halfway point of 2022, I figured I'd challenge myself to look back on my favorite cup filling moments from this year so far.\n\n\n### Board games at a bar (January)\n\n\n![Scrabble at Browns, with the fellas.](/blog-images/fill-your-cup/000-scrabble.webp)\n\nI'm a nerd at heart, and after months of Wordle, I had to put my new skills to the test. It turns out only mastering 5-letter words is not all that beneficial when it comes to playing Scrabble at Brown's. Regardless, board games at a bar is definitely an underrated activity.\n\n\n### A moment with some trash (February)\n\n\n![Me n’ my trash!](/blog-images/fill-your-cup/001-garbage-cleanup.webp)\n\nI hadn't planned an event in ages. After a year of mostly typing 60 WPM in front of Visual Studio Code (or Vim, if I'm feeling adventurous), it felt great to organize a beach clean-up on the UBC campus. This is a nice moment I had with some trash, after the event.\n\n\n### Volunteering at Collision Conf 2022 (June)\n\n\n![Volunteering at Collision 2022.](/blog-images/fill-your-cup/002-collision.webp)\n\nAnd last but not least, my favorite recent highlight has to be volunteering at this year's Collision Conf. I still remember dreaming of attending as a first-year student working on my first, rather half-baked start-up idea. Since then, my passion for founding has only grown, and I'll be looking to get to work in this last half of 2022. I'll definitely be back at Collision, though hopefully as a founder rather than a volunteer!\n\n\n## In sum\n\n\nSo, those are my cup filling moments. As I battle of this week's edition of the Sunday Scaries, finally getting back to writing again just might fill my (rather average-sized) cup for today."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on July 18th, 2020.\n\nIt's a Friday after classes. I'm grabbing a quick bite at one of UBC's only on-campus sit-down restaurants with a close friend, and a Gmail notification appears on my phone. As soon as I saw \"UBC\" in the subject line, I already knew what it was going to be.\n\nStudents had already been buzzing about it for the past week, and I even [tweeted](https://twitter.com/michaelfromyeg/status/1238500414053429248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) about it. We were _finally_ going online.\n\n> Classes are suspended at the UofA, UofT, McGill, Stanford, Western, UDub, Harvard, and UBC is still open... Pumped to go earn my 2% iClicker participation marks today.\n\n\t—Michael DeMarco (@michaelfromyeg) [March 13, 2020](https://twitter.com/michaelfromyeg/status/1238500414053429248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nTrailing behind the universities I mentioned in my Tweet, all of our classes were going remote starting the following Monday. Even though I had seen it coming, I was still a bit shell shocked. I think everyone had their \"COVID-19 moment\", where it stopped being a headline you read about in the news, and started dictating your way of life. Mine came in a 3-part saga.\n\nFirst, it was [Hacktech](https://hacktech.io/). Over Christmas break, a friend shared that Caltech's hackathon had opened their applications for 2020, and I thought it'd be a neat opportunity. I poured over my application, and with a bit of good fortune, got accepted. I booked my ticket to Pasadena and could hardly contain my excitement. Then, it moved online. Four-hundred dollars down the drain, I was a bit disappointed, but I got some friends together from UBC and ended up actually submitting a [project](https://rapviz.appspot.com/) and earning a finalist distinction. This was a solid silver-lining; my fingers are crossed that I may take part in the event next year.\n\n_More on RapViz: the source code for the project is available_ [_here_](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/rapviz)_. My teammates and I used Flask, React, and the Genius API to put this together. It definitely needs a touch-up, but the code is most of the way there. It also needs to be refactored, splitting apart the API code from the front-end._\n\n![Here’s RapViz.](/blog-images/my-covid-summer/000-rapviz.webp)\n\nSecond, it was, as I mentioned, school. Classes being online turned campus into a ghost town almost overnight. First-years flooded out of residents, clubs scrambled to pivot scheduled events online, and I clung on for dear life in each of my classes, submerged in school work. Within a few weeks, I managed to find a somewhat free weekend, pack my life away into four plastic boxes, and drive back to Edmonton. Over that weekend, I got an email from a software developer at the Government of Canada letting my know the internship I had just interviewed for was being eliminated. It was a bad week, to say the least.\n\nThird, it was [SUNIA](https://sunia.ca/). SUNIA is this week-long summer program I've worked with for nearly three years now. I started off in a generic programming coordinator role, helping make UN-related educational material; in my second year, I led marketing and did a fair amount of graphic design, while also working as our \"CTO\" (I snicker at the title, too); this year, I was working as the staff registrar, and also doing a bit more technology related work. [SUNIA got cancelled.](https://sunia.ca/covid) Again, like my semester moving online, I had seen this coming, but still, it meant my fears about a fully indoors summer and an online fall semester were validated.\n\nI was defeated, but I still wanted to make something of my summer. Being so late in the recruiting year, my outlook was fairly bleak. [Here's](https://notion.so/michaelfromyeg/49058c86c8d44605b65f9637d8f9e8a7?v=3acd8e103476491f833c4d69a39995df) the Notion page where I tracked my applications. Nothing too exciting of note; I had to apply to a ton of start-ups, some unpaid internships, and a lot of, erm, _interesting_ positions, to say the least.\n\n![My Notion job board.](/blog-images/my-covid-summer/001-notion.webp)\n\nThen, I thrice got lucky. The first stroke of luck came in the form of an offer to TA an introductory computer science class. I had TA'd during the second semester of my first-year, and leveraging that, I nabbed a TA position for the first summer term. Being only a 10-hour per week role, I still wanted to do a little more. But, it was a definite start.\n\nI also was able to leverage LinkedIn and find a part-time position with my school's Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department. If I'm honest, I think posting on LinkedIn is mostly a waste of time. There's just too much clutter on the platform; your time would be better spent working in public on GitHub, and tweeting your progress. But again, somehow a post of mine reached a communications lead working with ECE who thought I'd be a good fit for a position they'd just opened. ECE wanted to launch a new website they were working on, but needed help seeing it across the finish line. Their [old website](https://ece.ubc.ca/), built using Drupal, was getting near-impossible to maintain, and they had already made a dent in a new WordPress site. With ECE, I've written a [few](https://ece.ubc.ca/news/202005/ece-capstone-faculty-award-recipients) [blog](https://ece.ubc.ca/news/202006/ece-phd-candidate-awarded-prestigious-microsoft-research-grant) [posts](https://ece.ubc.ca/news/202007/ubc-masc-student-developing-wearable-device-track-heart-and-brain-signals) about research ECE grads are doing, wrote a lot of HTML, CSS, and a bit of PHP for the new WordPress site, maintained some legacy code on Drupal, and done a bit of marketing work. It's been a cool gig. I also wrote a few projects to help me automate tasks at work. [Here's](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/pylink) one, which interprets HTTP status codes into a \"report\", given a list of URLs, and [here's](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/rECEsearch) another, which collects UBC ECE research and formats it in a way which can be uploaded to WordPress.\n\nFinally, there was a _third_ stroke of luck I would never have seen coming. For the past few months, I'd been doing _ish_ contract work with a IoT company called [Artesian Software](https://artesiansoft.com/). I say _ish_ because though I was on board as a developer, there was simply no work to be done. Then, thankfully, around about mid-May, the company signed a contract, and we were off to the races. We've been building a platform to support businesses communicate with customers post-COVID. You can see my handiwork [here](https://shieldscore.com/). I get to work on a modern tech stack, which is a nice change of pace from Drupal: React (and React Native at one point), Node, SCSS, AWS (RDS with PostgreSQL, Dynamo, Cognito), ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, and more. I've worked with the Stripe API, created my first microservice, learned a ton about REST, and even more about React.\n\n![The ShieldScore product.](/blog-images/my-covid-summer/002-artesian.webp)\n\nWanting to write a bit more code, I also joined an online community for hackers looking to replicate the in-person intern experience called [Summer of Shipping](https://summerofshipping.com/), and joined a pre-seed accelerator [program](https://studentstartuplife.com/programs/student-summer-program) from Startup Edmonton, where I've been building [weNote](https://wenote.ca/). I've also participated in a couple of hackathons; at one I wrote [a VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michaelfromyeg.vscode-puzzle) to help you practice interview-style coding problems in your editor, which won me the \"best use of an external API award.\" (Even though I wrote my own API and did some, erm, questionable scraping. Whoops.) It currently has 14 installs, which is pretty cool!\n\n_Quick update for 2022: it now has 127+ installs and 10+ stars on_ [_GitHub_](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/vscode-puzzles)_! Development is still actively continuing; my next planned feature is to support puzzles from Advent of Code._\n\nLooking forward to the fall semester, I'm definitely nervous. Online school is hard. There's no getting around that fact. I'll be moving back to Vancouver, so hopefully cutting down the distance and being at least in the vicinity of campus should help my productivity. I'll also gain a bit of a community to rely on.\n\nBeyond the fall, I also have to hunt down co-op positions for winter and summer 2021. The COVID and post-COVID job market is assuredly a \"buyer's market,\" meaning that employers now have the pick of the litter when it comes to applicants. It's a scary reality, but it's one that's not going away anytime soon. My plan, for now at least, is to keep building projects, keep learning, keep being curious, and to stay vigilant. I'm not going to bother betting on getting lucky with offers again; lightning never strikes twice in the same place."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on August 10th, 2019.\n\n![My high school!](/blog-images/michaels-declassified-school-survival-guide/000-mcnally.webp)\n\nHigh school is complicated in more ways than one. From Degrassi-esque social drama to life-altering career decisions, it can be seriously difficult to maintain your grades. However, there are some simple tricks to ease the learning process and make your education systematic-that is, without all the overhead of figuring how to do this whole school thing. By following these three tips, you'll surely see a boost in your productivity and an ease in your hectic high school life.\n\nFirst, the schedule. Scheduling is no easy task! But nothing will hinder your high school experience more than not even being able to see what's in front of you. Scheduling has a myriad of benefits, from being able to see hectic exams days in advance, giving yourself free-time, and preventing yourself from double booking. One of the most common high school troubles is when teachers schedule numerous projects and exams for the same day. I like to call this \"the slog.\" The easiest way to get out of the slog is to jump out in front of it. You'll be surprised how receptive teachers are if you let them know early on that you won't be able to turn something in; however, teachers will not hesitate to dock you marks if you let them know the day of. All of this comes from scheduling. The easiest way to get started is to use an app like Google Calendar. This allows you to sync from your phone to your computer, and you can catch overlaps in your schedule as soon as they appear. Once you're comfortable with using Google Calendar, try to set a daily time to determine your schedule for the next day or week. This way, your studying time and project work periods can also be booked before they get away from you.\n\nSecond, the strategy. By high school, you likely have a good sense of what style of learner you are. But don't fret about the often exclaimed learner categories—be it \"aural,\" \"visual,\" or \"kinesthetic\"—these terms are often too narrow for most students. Instead, work class-by-class. In math, does it help more to do loads of practice or to do just the difficult questions? In English, do you need to spend more time planning, or are you better off working through your ideas as you write? Explicitly outlining these strategies, analogous to you being your own coach, can help you consciously approach your learning. Be flexible with this though! If a strategy is failing, just like a great coach, switch it up. As long as you're sure of yourself, your learning strategy is more likely to succeed.\n\nLast of all, the life. Though it may be tempting at times, when you're bracing for a scholarship and pushing for a spot at your favoured university, never let school trump your personal endeavors. Always maintain the activities you enjoy to ensure both your mental and physical health through the often tumultuous times. Eat three times a day, and try beginning your mornings with protein-heavy breakfasts. Sugar-rich cereals do little to boost your energy throughout the day, but a morning protein boost can give you that crucial edge.\n\nTrying to maintain these three things-the schedule, the strategy, and the life-is the crux of living your best life in high school. First and foremost, put your best foot forward, with these ambitions and motives in the back of your mind, and you'll be sure to thrive throughout high school."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on May 6th, 2019.\n\nSome of my readers may know that I recently decided what I'll be doing past high school: studying computer science. This is very exciting as I now feel much more focused and fulfilled. I do find now that it is strange sitting in English classes and the like and trying to stay as motivated as I was. I now know that this subject won't be consequential to my life. However, I still enjoy all of my classes and have loved my school year so far.\n\nSomething I want to touch on in this piece is how I came to that decision. It's a very muggy thing, trying to decide what you're going to do after high school, and there's mounds of questionable advice out there. \"Follow your passion!\" is one quip I hear a lot. This is terrible advice. Your passion alone should not inform what you do, because it might not make sense with a few others things: what you're good at, what the world actually needs, and what you can make money for.\n\nI did a little research, and stumbled across the Japanese concept of ikigai. Of course, I won't explain it perfectly, so I encourage you to check this out on your own, but I'll try my best. Ikigai is a Japanese term for \"a reason for being,\" similar to ‘raison d'etre' and other expressions. In the culture of Okinawa, ikigai is thought of as \"a reason to get up in the morning.\" Seems pretty cool right? So what does it actually look like? Well, I'll start with this venn diagram:\n\n![The Ikigai 4-way venn diagram.](/blog-images/ikigai/000-ikigai.webp)\n\nA four way venn diagram, so maybe not totally clear. Let's try to understanding what's going on. There are four categories, as mentioned. What you love, what you can be paid for, what the world needs, and what you're good at. Each of these intersect to fill different roles in our life: profession, vocation (a side hustle or a \"calling\"), mission, and passion. Now it's clear how passion alone is dangerous: it doesn't factor in money or the world at large. At the center of all of these concepts is harmony: ikigai. There are also cautions surrounding the venn diagram. Let's dissect them.\n\nWithout having what the world needs, we feel \"satisfaction, but a feeling of uselessness.\" In our lives, we need to contribute to something greater, and to feel a higher purpose (regardless of our spirituality). Across from that is where we lack any money behind our work; we have \"delight and fullness, but no wealth.\" Don't get too caught up in money though, there's a minimum you have to maintain to lead a satisfying life, and beyond that money begins to dictate your personality. What that baseline is varies from person-to-person, but try to determine what life you want to lead, and this can inform your salary goals. On the bottom right it reads, \"excitement and complacency, but sense of uncertainty.\" In this example, we haven't taken advantage of our skills. This would create a similar apathy and sadness, as we feel we could achieve something greater. Lastly, to the left from there, it reads: \"comfortable, but a feeling of emptiness.\" We need to have work that we love, otherwise, we dive deep into our work. Your life's achievements need to have a personal element to them to bring you joy!\n\nSo, there you have it: ikigai. A tangible way to think about what you want to do with your life. There are no wrong answers with ikigai, and if you ever feel you are missing something, you're never at a dead end. There are always chances to pick up a new hobby, work with a new organization, or challenge yourself somehow.\n\nOh, and how did I use ikigai to decide my major? I focussed on the intersection between what I was good at, and what I could be paid for. The world needs a lot of things, and there are lots of bright people working towards those things in their careers, so I didn't want that to necessarily inform my major. I'll put a pause on world domination for now. Moreover, I'm the type that loves virtually all of my work, so I didn't find that helpful in deciding. So, I had narrowed it down to what made money. Countless jobs have a salary I would be more than happy with. Some that stuck out included work in academia, STEM-centered jobs, potentially even law. Then I thought about what I was good at. I'm pretty flexible, but at more core I have a few main talents: math, problem-solving, and communicating. Well, a job that fuses that quite well is in computer science, where problems must be solved and presented to consumers!\n\nIf you have any questions about ikigai, you're always welcome to reach out at [~~me@michaeldemar.co~~](mailto:me@michaeldemar.co) michaelfromyeg [at] gmail [dot] com.

So I thought I'd put it to good use and share some of my favorites. Here are ten newsletters to brighten up your dreary inbox.\n\n[The Daily Pnut](https://dailypnut.com/)… _The best newsletter, hands down_\n\nThe Daily Pnut describes itself as a newsletter about world affairs that will \"make you sound marginally more intelligent.\" It's my all-time favorite newsletter. With gripping and poignant articles about current events with a (refreshing) non-American lens, The Daily Pnut captures our rapidly changing world in an enjoyable, daily newsletter. It's a must-subscribe.\n\n[Morning Brew](https://morningbrew.com/)… _Business news I can actually tolerate_\n\nBringing you the latest from \"Wall Street to Silicon Valley,\" the Morning Brew is a great financial newsletter for people less knowledgeable on the jargon, but still curious. It's consistently entertaining and lively. If you're interested in the financial world, the Morning Brew is a great way to stay in-the-know.\n\n[Vox Sentences](https://vox.com/vox-sentences)… _The news, but shorter_\n\nConsuming one news source makes you biased, so why not consume them all? Vox Sentences combines snippets from a variety of organizations (though, you'd be hard-pressed to find a Fox quote), and places them together to create short pieces on current events. Always informative and covers pressing issues.\n\n[Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/)… _Brain Food newsletter_\n\nFarnam Street's \"Brain Food\" newsletter covers a variety of mental models and ways of thinking about the world. For lack of a better term, it's damn cool.\n\n[BetterExplained](https://betterexplained.com/)… _Math explained better_\n\nBetter Explained's monthly newsletter showcases articles from their blog which take difficult concepts from mathematics, economics, and other fields and creates intuitive ways of understanding them. Through analogies and no-brainer explanations, this blog makes even the most rigorous calculus concept comprehensible.\n\n[The Ann Friedman Weekly](https://annfriedman.com/)… _Personal lens_\n\nIn this weekly newsletter Ann Friedman shares what she's been reading, and where she's at in life. It's uniquely personal lens makes this newsletter consistently interesting.\n\n[Noticing](https://kottke.org/newsletter)… _Interesting nuggets from around the web_\n\nNoticing collects cool and quirky nuggets of information from around the web. It's the StumbleUpon of newsletters. I love it.\n\n[Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)… _Asking the real questions_\n\nA thought-provoking newsletter exploring the bigger questions, with stick figures. Because, how else would you figure out the meaning of life?\n\n[Brain Pickings](https://brainpickings.org/)… _Scratch your noggin' with these reads_\n\nAgain, essentially just a mish mash of really cool stuff. This newsletter is particularly beautifully written as well. Its eloquence only makes it more enticing.\n\n[Exponential View](https://exponentialview.co/)… _A nod to what's next_\n\nWith a specifically-futurist lens, Exponential View takes a glimpse into what the next few decades will hold. (However good or not they may be.)"

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on July 1st, 2017.\n\n![Hacking away at nwPlus 2019.](/blog-images/all-about-hackathons/000-hackathon.webp)\n\nLast weekend, I participated in my first ever hackathon. HackED 2019 is put on by the Computer Engineering Club at the University of Alberta, and follows a similar format to most hackathons. First, there was an opening ceremony to introduce various sponsors, prizes, and relevant information to the competition. Then, we were released into the wild for twenty-four straight hours to produce a piece of software that did a cool thing. And finally, after all was said and done, us bleary-eyed programmers faced the judges and showed off our product.\n\n_Michael from the future here! We created this very vintage Java application for tracking student grades. If you're bored, feel free to poke around the repository_ [_here_](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/student-gradebook)_. It was my first interaction with Java, Swing, and OOP on a sizeable project._\n\nSo that's the gist: 24 hours, code something cool, try to win. Let's cut to the chase: why should you do it?\n\nFirst reason: to learn. Hackathons are a great place to get started with programming. This was a bit of a surprise to me—many people at a hackathon go out of their way to learn a new technology with their project. At HackED 2019, my friends and I built something in Java, and we were all somewhat familiar. However, most decide to branch out and spend the twenty-four hours learning as much as they code. And it works. Because odds are, at a hacking conference with many, many hackers, someone else is probably already familiar with what you're struggling with. So one call-for-help and bam, the support is there. There is no better place to jump into a new programming language than a hackathon.\n\nSecond reason: to collaborate. Especially as a high school student, we don't often have to code together. We write projects, submit them to our instructor, rinse and repeat. When you work at a hackathon, you have to collaborate on code with your peers. For students of code who are new to this, using Git can having interesting results. Thankfully, at HackED there was a Git workshop so it wasn't a total bust. But having to do it first-hand with your friends is the best way to learn, plain and simple. And if you plan to work on any open source projects, it's a need-to-know skill.\n\nThird reason: to network. There are so many bright, eager minds at these events with people interested in everything from Raspberry Pi to Flask to R, etc. You can learn so much just by striking up a simple conversation. At HackED, I learned a ton about post-secondary options, job options for computer scientists in Edmonton, and more. Hackathons are a great way to meet other folks in the industry.\n\nAll in all, go to a hackathon! You won't regret it. Your programming skills will thank you later.\n\nAs a bonus, here are a couple screenshots of what we built at HackED 2019.\n\n![homepage.png](/blog-images/all-about-hackathons/001-homepage.webp)\n\n![4c5e05e6-a4d6-45c0-bb79-80be3184ced6.png](/blog-images/all-about-hackathons/002-4c5e05e6-a4d6-45c0-bb79-80be3184ced6.webp)\n\n![fc0071fa-fa08-45e6-9881-357275cf772f.png](/blog-images/all-about-hackathons/003-fc0071fa-fa08-45e6-9881-357275cf772f.webp)"

Take a look at Genius' version, [Check The Rhyme](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1VNHp_flJKE), or Vox's, [Rapping, deconstructed: The best rhymers of all time](https://youtube.com/watch?v=QWveXdj6oZU). These videos get millions, and I mean millions of hits online. Why? Well, it's fun! And it's cool. The basic concept is that rap lyrics are \"broken down\" and the rhyming groups are highlighted. Often the videos will do this on a syllable-by-syllable basis, but also sometimes do multi-word rhymes! For this project, we wanted to start simple and focus on single, whole word rhymes.\n\nWe thought we could leverage NLP, a couple of freely available APIs, and some basic React so create a website that generates these kinds of \"highlighted\" rhymes. So what happened?\n\n\n### Usage\n\n\nThe user is presented with one of two options. They may either submit their own bars into a text field, or they can sign into Spotify and have their current song's lyrics analyzed. The lyrics are printed out with the rhyme scheme highlighted.\n\n\n### How it's made\n\n\nWe used a Flask backend to write a couple of endpoints to help us LyricsGenius, an API for scraping lyrics from Genius. We also wrote our NLP-based rhyme detection algorithm in Python and processed all of that data on the backend. Spotify authentication and the UI was all handled by React. We eventually deployed our app to Google Cloud so other users could try it.\n\n\n### Challenges\n\n\nDeveloping the rhyme algorithm was really tricky, especially getting it to be fast enough (eventually down to O(n) time!). We also ran into issues integrating Spotify into our app, but eventually got it sorted.\n\n\n### Accomplishments\n\n\nWe are able to programmatically generate what would take a video editor likely a couple of hours to do! Leveraging modern web technologies and NLP, displaying the rhyme scheme of a song proved to be a challenging but very possible feat.\n\n\n### Future\n\n\nCheck out our [issues](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/RapViz/issues) on GitHub! Though it was built at a hackathon (and there's quite a bit of spaghetti code) this is definitely a project I want to continue developing in the future."

In the course, my partner Max and I got a hands-on introduction to machine learning with Python via sklearn._\n\n![ales-nesetril-credit-card-unsplash.jpg](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/000-ales-nesetril-credit-card-unsplash.webp)\n\n[hw6.pdf](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f52dee6c-7688-4d58-bd02-08fdc7967ec0/a17772b6-6f22-48c8-8fa5-4bba492fff91/hw6.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45FSPPWI6X%2F20241230%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20241230T023416Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=36013b0ac0d100ece92910bade358ccb4cb0cd3b2a2c8db0434214bb8ffc30d9&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)\n\n\n## Problem\n\n\nDefaulting on a credit card payment is a challenging situation for all those involved. The individual who defaulted is tasked with rebuilding their credit score, and the issuer is laden with the debt. Ideally, a financial institution could _predict_ whether or not someone will default ahead of time, and prevent it from happening in the first place.\n\nWhile this is a daunting task—and one that requires sensitivity given the fact we are dealing with people's financial livelihoods—this is a situation where machine learning can be of use.\n\n\n### Question\n\n\nWe'll apply machine learning techniques to answer the following question.\n\n> Will this person default next month on their credit card payment?\n\nWith data relating to that person's demographics, payment history, and other financial information, we can attempt to predict the answer to this question.\n\n\n### Data\n\n\nThe data set we used is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In contains demographic information such as sex, education, marriage and age; information regarding and individual's finances including limit balance, repayment status, bill amounts, and payment amounts. Finally, it contains whether or not that individual really _did_ default next month.\n\nThis is simply a high-level description of the data; for a more in-depth view, consult Kaggle or our [full report](https://www.notion.so/michaelfromyeg/hw6.pdf).\n\n\n## Exploration\n\n\nBefore we delve into our analysis, let's get a better sense of the data available.\n\nTo begin with, we portioned off a chunk of our data, namely 25%, to eventually assess our model's effectiveness after our model is already created. Let's explore the remnants.\n\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis (\"EDA\")\n\n\nWe have 225,000 rows in our data available for training use, each representing an individual and their associated \"features\" (such as age or sex) as outlined above.\n\nThe \"average\" demographic in this data is someone who's single (instead of married), has a university-level education, and an age of about 35.\n\nThe individual with the highest limit balance is a 47 year old female with precisely NT$1,000,000 available, equivalent to roughly USD$100,000. This is definitely an outlier; the distribution for the rest of the balances is shown below. (Note dollar amounts are in New Taiwan dollars.)\n\nWe find most balances in the range of NT$50,000 (~USD$6,500) to NT$100,000 (~USD$13,000) which seems reasonable.\n\n![distribution-of-payamt2.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/001-distribution-of-payamt2.webp)\n\n![distribution-of-limitbal.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/002-distribution-of-limitbal.webp)\n\n![distribution-of-classes.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/003-distribution-of-classes.webp)\n\nThe repayment statuses in the month of August 2005 are, for whatever reason, highly skewed towards 0, which is the encoding of \"use of revolving credit.\" A visualization of this is shown below.\n\nIt might be interesting to investigate any geopolitical events that occurred in the same time frame of this data set, the summer and fall of 2005, to account for any global financial trends.\n\nWith a better understanding of the data at hand, we proceed to our analysis.\n\n\n## Analysis\n\n\nBelow is a description of our final model, and the results it yielded.\n\n\n### Model\n\n\nFor our final model we opted to use [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which is a gradient boosted tree based model. Gradient boosted models are ensembles of weaker prediction models, in our case, decision trees.\n\nLightGBM greatly outperformed the Decision Tree model. It also consistently outperformed the Random Forest model, even after we performed feature selection using `RFECV` and hyperparameter optimization using random search.\n\n\n### Results\n\n\nThe LightGBM model achieved an accuracy of 0.82, F1-score of 0.48, and recall of 0.38. This means that from our test data, we would correctly predict whether or not someone would default about 82% of the time. Among all of the examples of \"did default,\" we're correct only 38% of the time (—given the imbalance in the data set, this is somewhat to be expected). These results are promising, and should generalize well on \"deployment data\" since the test and validation scores are similar.\n\nIt's also interesting to look at how important our features were in the LightGBM model. SHAP force plots are one way of achieving this; without diving into depth here, just know that \"red\" means \"did not default,\" and a bigger arrow implies more impact.\n\nIn the two plots above, we see that PAY1 played a major role. Perhaps this is because if an individual gets off on the wrong foot, they are unlikely to ever recover. Banks might be incentivized to try to get on top of late payments immediately, to prevent financial hardships from spiraling into an eventual default!\n\n![shap-force2.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/004-shap-force2.webp)\n\n![shap-force1.png](/blog-images/predicting-credit-card-defaults/005-shap-force1.webp)\n\n\n## Reflection\n\n\nWhile we are satisfied with our results, there are some caveats that should be made known before anyone attempts to use this model on \"real world\" use-cases.\n\nFirstly, the given data suffers from class imbalance. Most of our examples were of type \"did not default,\" at a ratio of nearly 3-to-1. The imbalance in our data was naturally occurring, so we asked ourselves what kind of error we were trying to minimize. We were concerned with minimizing false negatives, and so we chose to focus on recall as our evaluation metric. Sometimes naturally occurring class imbalance is okay to ignore. However, we believe that a possible improvement of our modeling could be to undersample or oversample the data to attempt to further address class imbalance.\n\nSecondly, the data available here was highly localized. All of our examples were from Taiwan, and so it is likely that our modeling would not generalize well to anywhere else in the world. Applying this model as a US Bank, for example, would be inappropriate as different cultures may exhibit different financial habits.\n\nFinally, there may have been overfitting on the hyperparameters. The final model described here was not our only attempt at this problem; rather, it was just our best attempt. Since we re-tested with various models and ran our hyperparameter tuning more than once it is _possible_ that we unintentionally overfit our model.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nFrom our data set, we were able to produce a LightGBM model that showed promising results, with a recall score of 0.38. In the future, we could look to further tune our LightGBM attempt to improve on our performance!\n\nThanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed it."

The course uses Java, and likewise this project was made using Java and JavaFX for the UI. I asked my girlfriend if she had any project ideas, and she mentioned she struggled keeping track of citations for her assignments, so I wanted to build a tool that could meet her needs. I felt the exact same feeling when I wrote my 4,000 word Extended Essay in high school. Trying to remember and keep track of citations can be hard if you're not an experienced writer.\n\n\n### Usage\n\n\nA user can create an account and manage a list of assignments. With each assignment, they can paragraph-by-paragraph manage citations (e.g., who are you citing, what page number, etc.) and then automatically generate a works-cited page with reported \"confidence.\"\n\n![zotero.png](/blog-images/jcite/000-zotero.webp)\n\n\n### How it's made\n\n\nThe project is made with vanilla Java and JavaFX.\n\n\n### Challenges\n\n\nI struggled quite a bit with the algorithm to generate citations, but I'm happy with what I ended up with! Maybe I'll release it separately as an API or something.\n\n\n### Accomplishments\n\n\nI think the project structure is quite nice, and I'm happy with the UI! It was my first time using JavaFX.\n\n\n### Future\n\n\nIt'd be cool to port this to an Android app or something. I should also probably created a \"released\" version."

Source code available [here](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/groUber).\n\ngroUber is aimed to help event planners create carpools and was built for To the Moon and Hack, [an MLH event](https://mlh.io/). (If you're going to use this project to plan your event, remember to stay 6ft apart!)\n\n\n### Motivation\n\n\nThis project was built by a group of 5 students from UBC in Vancouver, BC who love automating things. And one horrific task all of us have run into when planning our events is creating a workable carpool schedule.\n\nIt's a great option for getting your group together: whether it be parents figuring out how best to get their kids to soccer practice, or friends accommodating those without access to a car, carpooling is common, but creating a plan can be painful, to say the least.\n\nYou finally come up with a workable schedule: everyone can make it to the event, no driver has to go in annoying, wasteful loops, and everything can start on time.\n\nThen a driver with 4 seats drops out. And you have to do it all over again. No, thanks.\n\n\n### Introducing: groUber\n\n\nWith groUber, never go through that headache again. As an event organizer, create your event, send an invite link to your friends, and create a carpool schedule with one click. As a participant, simply receive a link, RSVP, and inform the organizer of how many seats you have available. You'll receive a schedule on the day-of.\n\nUsing the Radar API and the Google Maps API, along with a bit of algo-magic, our app will create the most optimal carpool schedule for everyone involved. We were hesitant to do this project at first; the idea of designing an algorithm to find the \"best\" carpool strategy was intimidating to say the least. After some research, it turns out this is actually classified an NP-hard problem. We didn't need to solve the problem generally though, and were able to design a heuristic algorithm to be able to compute this with fairly good results. Here are a few examples of scholarly work in this area. It took great teamwork, persistence, and a decent amount of caffeine to get this working.\n\nNow, drivers won't have to waste gas, and everyone will get there on time. Someone drops out? No problem, our app will allow you to adjust your schedule, painlessly.\n\ngroUber is ride-sharing for your group of friends, without all the expenses and overhead. Do a favor for the environment, and for your stress-levels, and start using groUber today.\n\nHere's our [whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSLo8DhZ7p-VgPnmieasD01zZ2_76uMxPxSwVErq3_gQPvpokrFI4G5SHA1Pxrc9b9ouhK5yvL-4X3t/pub) where you can find a more in-depth justification for this hack! We also have a [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRY4A2dxP3vd1L7tY9gNC1Y0oegweKaiE9ZRHzulQArcLDld2zxErJQPk2TWvtwONXqdFWSECFlWEhh/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=15000&slide=id.p) for the visual learners out there.\n\n\n### Stack\n\n\n\n- TypeScript, React\n- Node.js, npm\n\n- Firebase, including authentication, hosting, and Firestore\n- GitHub Actions\n\n\n### Usage\n\n\nHead to [grouber.online](https://grouber.online/). Sign-up using your Google account.\n\nCreate your event with all key details, and send an invite to your to-be attendees. Once they RSVP, you'll see their details on your event dashboard. Then, generate your event's carpool schedule in one click!\n\nParticipants must submit their address, if they're driving, and if so, how many seats they have available in their vehicle.\n\nCheck out some screenshots of the application below!\n\n![grouber.png](/blog-images/grouber/001-grouber.webp)\n\n![homescreen.png](/blog-images/grouber/002-homescreen.webp)\n\n![RSVPPage.jpg](/blog-images/grouber/003-RSVPPage.webp)\n\n![appMap.jpg](/blog-images/grouber/004-appMap.webp)\n\n![branding.png](/blog-images/grouber/005-branding.webp)\n\n![dashboard.jpg](/blog-images/grouber/006-dashboard.webp)\n\n\n### Contributing\n\n\nCheck out the GitHub repository for more information."

      "content": "In my first year of high school, I had the luxury of spending an all-inclusive weekend in Lacombe, Alberta. In case you’re not familiar, Lacombe is a city in central Alberta, 125 kilometers south of Edmonton and home of the Len Thompson Manufacturing Plant (that part, of course, you already knew). In 2017, it was home to the Alberta Student Leadership Conference. The website is still up, [here](https://connectedleaders.weebly.com/).\n\n![A poster from the conference. 800 student leaders!](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/000-image.webp)\n\nI went, starry eyed, to learn how to lead. And learn I did! (My whole leadership experience in high school would be a blog post on its own.) I attended countless workshops, keynotes, and lunches. And what did I get at each of them? (Besides, you know, leadership skills.) Paper. In some form or another: pamphlets, brochures, photos, postcards, name tags, bookmarks. You name it, I got one.\n\nComing home, I was faced with a serious dilemma. How was I going to possibly save all of this essential learning material? My printed-out-Polaroids? Or further still, my conference badge?! My mother (as always) had the solution. \n\nThe Hilroy Studio® Scrap Book.\n\n![The scrap book, in all its glory.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/001-big_HLR26411.webp)\n\nThis series of twenty manila pages, coil-bound and enveloped in a firm blue cover has served as the springboard for a decade of creative cataloging. My now fourteen-book long series is a living memoir that has served as a window into my past (translated into two-dimensional form). A collection featuring romantic letters and nasty break-ups, acceptance letters and untimely rejections, postcards from around the planet and receipts from my local liquor store. It’s got everything.\n\nAfter occupying a corner of my bedroom for the past year, I recently sent them home to Edmonton (as I moved to San Francisco, to begin New Grad Life). I packed them up and shipped them off to the Great White North. However, while on a mini graduation trip in Tofino, British Columbia, my mom remarked that while one of the two boxes I sent home had arrived, the other was nowhere to be found. And of course, the missing box was the one with the scrapbooks.\n\nFor a short time, I was devastated. An entire decade of hand-picked, cherished collectibles had ostensibly been whisked away. Up until that point, I had never bothered to reflect on how much the cathartic cutting-and-pasting meant to me. It was just a sort-of offbeat hobby, a way to make sense of all the random Things that showed up in my pockets in my day-to-day life.\n\nThankfully, the scrapbooks did turn up only a handful of days later. The near-miss pushed me to think about how much this hobby had taught me about myself. And now, on the roughly ten year anniversary of the hobby, it’s time to finally share those reflections, and some of my favourite pages from along the way.\n\nFirst, I should share my Rules of The Scrap. \n\n1. Err on the side of keeping it\n\t1. Leaving a table at a restaurant? Scoop up the receipt. Have some miscellaneous paper in your pockets after a night out? Save it. Dump it all in a bin for later processing. I often find the most insignificant pieces (e.g., a receipt), to serve as the best starting point for a story (e.g., “remember how laughably bad the service was?”).\n2. Make it real, not ‘nice’\n\t1. Let’s be honest: life is often ugly and occasionally beautiful, and my scrapbook reflects that. ‘Scrap’ means discarded, leftovers—not fancy gel pens and cursive writing. It’s not Instagram-ified (i.e., limited to the top 1% of all my best memories), but rather a depiction of my whole self.\n3. The opening is dedicated to travel, and the last to former-selves\n\t1. Travel makes life long and special, so for me it appears first-and-foremost—boarding passes, bus tickets, luggage tags, and more adorn the opening page.\n\t2. I also _usually_ dedicate the last page to pieces of ID I no longer use, as a kind of goodbye to a phase of life.\n\nExpanding on 3(b), here is, for example, the last page of scrapbook #9, featuring Michael the Singaporean Exchange Student.\n\nFeaturing my ‘Tembusu Privilege Card’ (though after being a guest [there](https://tembusu.nus.edu.sg/), the real privilege was mine), my Cardiflex (which, like any card for a printer, never worked), my bus pass, debit cards from the world’s most annoying bank, my student ID, and my foreign ID (featuring a rather rough passport photo taken after a nearly 20 hour flight).\n\nAll once mainstays in my wallet, now at rest in scrapbook #9.\n\n![The ID cards of scrapbook #9.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/002-image.webp)\n\nI’ll amass content over about a one to three month period, and then spend an afternoon sorting the content. I rip out the interesting bits and pieces, and paste them in haphazardly. (Usually I’ll toss on a movie in the background. Since you got here, [you should follow me on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/michaelfromyeg/)!)\n\nFor me, the activity of making the scrap books is as significant as the scrap books themselves. (Forgive me, but I'm going to be a bit philosophical here.) We Humans (—capital ‘H’) toil away on the ol' Blue Marble. Purpose is something which we actively breathe into life. Those things which I scrap book—remnants from events, letters from relationships, receipts from dinners, and raffle tickets from the nights out—are, for me, little microcosms of our Purpose (—capital ‘P’) here. Life must be lived! Piecing together the scrap books makes me appreciate the insanity and innate wonder of our existence here—all The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.\n\nSoapboxing aside—here are some of my favorite pages from each, with some stories.\n\n![Scrapbook #12. From my trip to Vietnam, circa April 2023.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/003-image.webp)\n\n\n**Scrapbook #12**\n\nThe Ha Giang loop is probably some of the best travel you can do today. This is the route I took on the three day trip through north Vietnam.\n\nThe loop is so much more than getting on a motorbike and pressing the gas. It's the mishmash of people, the party, and the drivers themselves.\n\nHell, my driver (Thanh, pronounced 'Tyne,' which, to my amusement, is the real name of one of my other good friends) at just merely 26 years of age had four children. He had an inkling for YouTube trap-house mash-ups, and was astounded that a thing such as a [Big Booty Mix 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm3bt4Q39b8) exists.\n\n\n**Scrapbook #1**\n\nThere have been very few times I've written in, or allowed writing in the scrap books. One exception was my last day of high school. These people all mean a lot to me, despite the fact that I've seen a whopping ~4 of them consistently over the past 5 or so years.\n\nLife moves fast; this page is a grounding reminder that the people in your circle can change immediately, without warning. A reminder to call your friends and let them know they’re loved, however you express that. \n\n(Also, we should take a moment appreciate the absurdity in the top middle of the page, and the purported run for Prime Minister implied by 'Michael DeMarco 2020!!' in the bottom right—I'll take the votes.)\n\nOne more here: the 'Sorry Joey did you like that' was from prom. My best friend in high school, Jordan, and I campaigned for Best Bromance. In his best Steve Harvey impression, my friend announced it was uh—oh—I misread the names—and just like that we lost. Can't win them all!\n\n![Scrapbook #1.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/004-image.webp)\n\n![Scrapbook #6.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/005-image.webp)\n\n\n**Scrapbook #6**\n\nMe, as a game of Wordle. If you had to guess where this was used, what would you go for first? Maybe a residence hall event? Perhaps some other club social?\n\nHow about a fraternity party?\n\nTwice annually, I had the privilege of getting to decorate my room in some absurd theme courtesy of Phi Gamma Delta a.k.a. Fiji's 'Small Rooms' function. In the spring of 2021, Wordle was all the rage, and thus my friend Jacob and I Wordle-ified his room. I actually created a custom version of Wordle for our room ('Fijidle'), which eventually got DMCA'd by the New York Times for copyright infringement. [Yeah](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/13/1238142507/cease-desist-new-york-times-wordle-spin-offs).\n\n\n**Scrapbook #14**\n\nLast but not least, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout-out to the Coffee News. This is—seriously—one of the things I miss most from Alberta. It's a two-page spread featuring four off-the-wall or otherwise 'neat' news stories, quotes, a bit of trivia, Horoscopes, jokes, and a game to search for a drawing of a little man among the ad space.\n\nI guess my mom picked up on how much I enjoy the weekly editions, so has now begun stockpiling them, and mailing them out to wherever I happen to be on a monthly cadence. Thanks, mom.\n\n![Scrapbook #14.](/blog-images/a-decade-of-scrap-booking/006-image.webp)\n\n\n---\n\nThose are just a few cherry-picked highlights, but there's of course much more story to tell. So where do I go from here? \n\nI’m tinkering with ways for friends to join on the story. I want to create something like a series of [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) boards with collaborative \"sticky-noting\" of things that stick out to people. I do need to redact some of the content that’s a bit _too_ personal, but I think there's a cool, collaborative happy medium here.\n\nIdeas? Questions? Concerns? For the first two, feel free to write me at michaelfromyeg [at] gmail [dot] com; for the third, I'm not quite sure I care, so don't."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on October 29th, 2023.\n\nStory time. I'm bad at flying.\n\nBut I don't mean the act of flying, as a pilot. I mean as a passenger.\n\nHow can you be bad at packing your bags, going to the airport, filing through security, and hopping on a plane? Great question! I'm not sure, but after reading this, I think you'll be inclined to agree.\n\nRight now, I'm sitting in the Victoria airport after trying to board a short-haul flight to my hometown of Edmonton, having it cancelled and rebooked (instead through a three-way connection from Vancouver-Victoria-Calgary-Edmonton), then _illegally_ boarding my first flight with an expired license, only to get flagged in Victoria. That's right. I'm now stranded in YYJ all because I wanted to watch some Heritage Classic hockey. And for turning 22.\n\n![My four boarding passes, in all their glory.](/blog-images/im-bad-at-flying/000-boarding-passes.webp)\n\nThis morning was hell from start to finish. I woke up with a blistering hangover at the crack of dawn. The past night I'd spent Hall-o-weekend-ing and was now going to head to Edmonton to catch the Heritage Classic. It was the Battle of Alberta, and the first outdoor game in Edmonton in 20+ years. I convinced my whole family to go. I was elated! Upon arriving at the airport, however, I saw my flight was cancelled. I waited in a brutally long line of folks getting other flights sorted (including, but not limited to, some aspirant vacationers pleading to make it to Puerto Vallarta and a few Calgarians who faced a different, but similar cancellation—in that case, WestJet's probably doing them a favor by keeping them in Vancouver). It was only while waiting in this roughly hour-long line that I began to really feel the effects of running a half-marathon and clubbing the day prior. I was seething in pain, literally clutching one of the hand rails just desperate to take a nap on _some_ plane going somewhere.\n\nI finally got to the front, and the gate agent was friendly and understanding. \"You going to the game?\" I gave him a nod and he gave me one of the most ridiculous itineraries I've ever seen in return. First to Victoria, then to Calgary, _then_ to Edmonton, just in time for the 5pm puck drop. I had 20 minutes to make it to the gate, so I flew through security (with a bit of WestJet-endorsed line-cutting) and made it no problem. I boarded my flight with ease and had a smooth trip. What else could go wrong!\n\nLots. My connection from Victoria to Calgary got delayed, but not so much that I would miss my Edmonton connection. Annoying, but not an ordeal. I paid for a $22 breakfast sandwich, and finally started to fight off the hangover. I went to board the flight around 11am and the gate agent stopped me dead in my tracks. My license is expired?! There's no way! I _just_ **flew** here.\n\nI turned 22 on October 15th, 2023, and indeed, that's the day my license expired. Mind you I had bought alcohol, been to the club, and _boarded an aircraft_ with this identification. If I had had another piece of non-photo identification, I might've been able to board, but my other documents were with my passport at home. Boohoo. Back to Vancouver I go! Sheepishly, I messaged my family and transferred my mom the ticket.\n\nThis is where it gets better. When the gate agent told me I couldn't go, I wasn't that phased. **This isn't the first time my license has gotten me into plane-boarding trouble.**\n\n![Jasper, Alberta, Canada circa January 2021.](/blog-images/im-bad-at-flying/001-jasper.webp)\n\nStory time, again. Back in high school, I didn't get my license. So, during the summer after my freshman year, I did lessons with the Alberta Motor Association and was geared up for the exam. The only problem was the pandemic put a pause on the actual examinations. I had to write it in December, instead, when I was home for winter break.\n\nNo problem, I figured. I took the exam on the second last day of my trip home and passed with ease. I headed into the DMV to process the paperwork, and coincidentally was wearing my UBC hoodie. The DMV agent smartly asked if I'd need my license to fly back to Vancouver. After some discussion, we (that is, myself, the agent, and my mother, a.k.a., _my_ agent) agreed that the temporary one was fine. Why?!? I had no idea! That obviously makes no sense. But we all agreed.\n\nSo, when I got to the airport, I obviously wasn't let on. However, I needed to be back in Vancouver as soon as physically possible. I was scheduled to start my first-ever co-op gig with Samsung. I looked at flights and… $#!T! Everything was unbelievably expensive or booked out.\n\nI explored all other options. Bussing? No dice. How about… a train? The VIA Rail economy ticket wasn't too expensive (~$150 if I recall correctly). Done. Booked.\n\nAnd with that, I rode The Canadian from Edmonton to Vancouver in early January. The trip itself was stunning, with unbelievably gorgeous views of the Western Canada in wintertime. It was a bit eerie though, as the crowd on the train looked very no-fly-list-y. One dude in got kicked off in Northern British Columbia for using drugs in the washroom.\n\nThe other train ordeal was a massive blizzard that passed through the interior during the train travel. It knocked down a litany of trees, all over the tracks. This meant we would ride for twenty or thirty minutes, stop, clear the tracks, and go again. In the middle of nowhere! My mom had packed me peanut butter sandwiches for the train trip, and I had to start _rationing_ them. I killed time by trying to write unit tests for APK file extraction (…I was on the Knox team at Samsung). Not the most riveting stuff, I'll confess. Eventually, after nearly a complete **twenty-four-hour** delay, I made it back to Vancouver.\n\nYou would've thought that experience had taught me to carry my godforsaken passport, but evidently my hungover morning self was not exactly envisioning this exact scenario.\n\nFool me once, fool me twice. [And I'll probably make a fool of myself again](https://youtube.com/watch?v=aqGn-1XX7cI)."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on August 23rd, 2022.\n\nIt's been about two weeks since I wrapped up my position as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern at Amazon, and I wanted to reflect on my time there this summer. I often get asked about the full end-to-end experience of my time at Amazon, so before I get into what I worked on and what I learned, I'll first do a full re-wind to my initial application.\n\n\n## Working towards a FAANG offer\n\n\nIn recruiting for my third co-op term at UBC, I laid out definitive guidelines for the kind of position I was after. My primary objective was to work at a company solving complex, 'technically engaging' problems, to grow quickly as an early-career engineer. In addition to at-work complexity, I was also very interested in moving to a new city in Canada or the US, to grow personally and get a chance to travel to new places.\n\nI applied to Amazon in early August as soon as their applications opened. (For those of you currently recruiting, this is often an overlooked but highly important factor; big companies often recruit on a \"rolling-basis,\" meaning an early application is critical.) I chose Toronto largely on a whim.\n\n![The e-mail inviting me to interview at Amazon.](/blog-images/day-one-my-internship-at-amazon/000-amazon-interview-invitation.webp)\n\nI then completed two online assessments (OAs). The first was a fairly standard set of technical questions on HackerRank, and the second was a \"work simulation\" to assess behavioural skills asynchronously. I fortunately passed, and then scheduled a final-round 45-minute technical interview. The interview was also fairly standard; it consisted of technical and behavioural questions. Unique to Amazon, the behaviourals are focused on a set of [leadership principles](https://amazon.jobs/en/principles) (LPs) that, I can now attest, are embedded throughout company culture. I'll touch more on the LPs later.\n\n\n## Getting settled in Toronto\n\n\nMoving to Toronto was a rather involved experience. Immediately after wrapping up one of my most brutal final exam schedules to date, I had to pack, donate, or dump my items from BC that I had nested during the pandemic. (It was... a lot of stuff.) Then I was busy with Amazon's pre-onboarding while also recruiting for Fall 2022 internships. (That's a whole [other story](https://michaeldemar.co/blog/rescind-playbook).)\n\n![My final exam schedule. Back-to-back networking, databases, and operating systems was not fun.](/blog-images/day-one-my-internship-at-amazon/001-b0a06e05-cccb-441b-b1f0-abf023437428.webp)\n\n![Leo, my pet Russian tortoise, also had to be sent home to stay with my parents.](/blog-images/day-one-my-internship-at-amazon/002-leo.webp)\n\nI boarded my flight and was off to Toronto. As an Edmonton native, Toronto was rather overwhelming. The city is gigantic and there is always something bustling. It truly is a \"concrete jungle,\" especially when you're working in the heart of downtown, situated right between the CN Tower and Scotiabank Arena.\n\nThankfully, I was able to take full advantage of what the city has to offer. And with weekend trips to Montreal, Niagara, and Muskoka, there was no shortage of nearby entertainment throughout my three-and-a-half months in the city.\n\n\n## From big tech to Bigger tech\n\n\nThe next major adjustment for me came in navigating life at a huge company. Make no mistake: Samsung, where I previously interned, is also large. However, there is something truly unique about \"Amazon-scale.\" When your intern class is nearly 15,000 folks, things will assuredly feel a bit different.\n\nThankfully, I had an awesome team and intern class around me to support me throughout the onboarding process. Amazon's onboarding, while extensive, is also exhaustive, leaving you with a full set of tools and knowledge to thrive in your time there. My initial nerves were replaced by excitement, and I dove head-first into our tech stack.\n\nI got onboarded to my project relatively quickly. Within the Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) organization, I had the chance to work on a \"product tour.\" (Here's [an article](https://blog.asana.com/2018/10/move-fast-without-technical-debt-product-tours-react) from a former Asana intern about an analogous project for their core application.) It was built on top of a complex, multipage booking portal that used React. While I didn't anticipate being placed on a frontend project, I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would, and I learned a ton about today's challenges in scaling modern frontend technologies. (I'm even following this experience up by giving a React workshop at this year's [Hack The North](https://hackthenorth.com/) in Waterloo—make sure to tune in.)\n\n![My desk!](/blog-images/day-one-my-internship-at-amazon/003-amazon-desk.webp)\n\n\n## Six lessons from the six\n\n\nIt was rare I had a day at work without some new learning or takeaway. Here are six of my highlights.\n\n\n### Lesson #1: There are no bad questions\n\n\nWhile I had a decent chunk of relevant React experience to leverage for my project, our application was still complex and tens of thousands of lines of code long. To navigate the tricky waters that come with being an intern in engineering, questions are your lifeline. I was able to on-board to our project right away by scheduling impactful one-on-ones and remaining curious about our project's anatomy.\n\nPersonally, my Achilles' heel as an engineer is getting bogged down by particularly challenging problems (and there are no shortage of those at Amazon). Asking questions turned out to be a fantastic shortcut for getting to the heart of an issue.\n\n\n### Lesson #2: Complexity is evil\n\n\nThere is one special question you can ask: \"why?\" Asking the right \"why?\" can help determine what exactly is desired by your end-user (or \"customer,\" in Amazon terms) and minimize feature bloat. In particular, I had chats with PMs from separate teams (...in entirely different continents), so finding cohesion in product vision and preventing unneeded complexity required careful question-asking.\n\n(As any good [Grug-brain developer](https://grugbrain.dev/) knows, complexity is an existential threat, so it should be eliminated at all costs!)\n\n\n### Lesson #3: Agility is your friend\n\n\nSomething interesting about the project I worked on was that it was actually a continuation of a former intern project. Often, Amazon interns complete a design phase for their project, scoping out the minimum viable feature set for an initial release before jumping into implementation.\n\nFrom nearly my first day, I was working on delivering an already-scoped design. I love getting hands-on, but quickly found myself in a cobweb of only partially ready code. I didn't take enough time to understand and revise the existing timeline, which left me trying to ship many features at once.\nThis led to large code changes that were difficult to test and debug.\n\nInstead, try to be as lean as possible in your code. Small commits, small pull requests, and minimally scoped changes make it easy to bisect changes when things, inevitably, go wrong. Also: any refactoring work must be completed prior to shipping new features.\n\n\n### Lesson #4: Community is key\n\n\nIt takes a village to raise a child, and it also takes a village to raise an intern. It's critical to develop open communication lines between yourself and your \"support network\" on the job. At Amazon, this consisted of my mentor, manager, my manager's manager, and the most senior engineer on my team. Scheduling regular one-on-ones and documenting the discussions levelled up my experience tremendously.\n\nThe idea of community goes beyond your team as well. It's also essential to immerse yourself in activities with your fellow interns and the broader city you live in as well.\n\n\n### Lesson #5: Culture isn't just buzzwords\n\n\nAmazon's leadership principles (LPs) are embedded into the DNA of the company. My co-workers would constantly leverage the LPs to guide hard decisions or steer meetings in the right direction. Beyond being the backbone of Amazon's culture, the LPs are also just brimmed with great life advice. As a former leadership student in high school, I had a lot of fun trying to embed ideas like \"Ownership,\" \"Invent and Simplify\" and \"Learn and Be Curious\" into my day-to-day at Amazon.\n\n\n### Lesson #6: Have fun\n\n\nIt's easy to get wrapped up in work and find yourself constantly worrying about return offers, your next internship, and the various other stressors of everyday life. Kick back with your co-workers when the chance arises and make the most of your internship. To help center myself, I would often reflect on where I came from to end up at Amazon. This kind of mindfulness exercise helped me make the most of my time at Amazon.\n\n\n## So... what's next?\n\n\nWhile I could not be more grateful for my time at Amazon, I also could not be more excited for what this next year has in store. I have a chance this August to rest and reconnect with family before I join Tesla this fall on the Supercharging team. I'll also be serving as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) for my first-ever 300-level course; namely, \"Internet Computing\" (CPSC 317) at UBC with Professor Alan Wagner.\n\nQuestions?

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on July 17th, 2022.\n\nThis upcoming fall, I was set on making a number of fairly major life changes. Firstly, I was about to move from one of the world's largest technology companies to a cryptocurrency start-up. Secondly, I was going to pack my bags and move from Canada to Palo Alto, California. And thirdly, I was going to do it all basically on my own.\n\nAs of Thursday, I've been thrown back to square zero. Due to pressures in the cryptocurrency space, coined (pun-intended) a \"crypto winter\" (though frankly it seems pretty sunny in Toronto these days...), my offer at [BitGo](https://bitgo.com/) was rescinded.\n\n![The e-mail from BitGo.](/blog-images/the-rescinded-internship-offer-playbook/000-email.webp)\n\nTo be totally candid, I had kind of seen this coming. There were a number of major shake-ups with the early talent team that had recruited me in the first place, and I'd already seen the likes of Coinbase and Shopify pull similar moves. It's an unfortunate reality of working in an emerging industry, and I was aware of the risk in accepting the role. I'm still as passionate as ever about the potential of web3, and I know it won't be long until I'm back.\n\n![Shopify pulls internships.](/blog-images/the-rescinded-internship-offer-playbook/001-shopify.webp)\n\nI'm keeping my chin-up and have my focus fixed firmly on getting back to square one. In this post, I want to share my \"game plan\" for how I'm going to strive to achieve just that. It's essentially the advice I would give myself if I could go back two years and coach my freshman-self through a first round of internship applications. Hope you enjoy.\n\n\n## 1. Use your network\n\n\nThis piece is especially important when you're just getting started with recruiting in tech, or when you've faced a bit of a setback. To use a cliché, \"your network is your net worth!\" I find computer science doesn't have the same culture around recruiting, coffee chats, etc., as other industries, but it can truly accelerate your career.\n\nUse social media to be open about projects you're working on and roles you're looking for. Keep your profiles up-to-date and try to stay somewhat active throughout the year. I think everyone feels a bit of anxiety around posting on LinkedIn, but that's easily one of the most effective channels. I've had 25,000+ impressions on my latest post. \"Tech Twitter\" is also a great place to stay active; I often find early-stage founders recruit directly from the site. Relying on visible, open job applications like Indeed or LinkedIn is merely the tip of iceberg of what's out there!\n\n(Another more \"bold\" strategy is becoming a content creator YouTube. I've met a ton of cool people after posting [this](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9FP8esDPPKY) video on advice for getting into the computer science major at UBC. To this day, I continue to get emails and DMs from students all across the globe!)\n\nAlso, go to stuff! I love using apps like Eventbrite and Meetup to see what's happening in my area. Attending events is bar-none the best way to meet people; networking \"online\" is not nearly as effective as just bumping into strangers at a conference. Try to step out of your comfort zone and put yourself out there. You'd be surprised what can turn up!\n\n\n## 2. Don't be shy\n\n\nWhen it comes to recruiting, you simply cannot afford to be shy. It's akin to that hackneyed quote, \"shoot for the moon, and you're destined to land in the stars.\" Any ounce of impostor syndrome will hold you back from sending that one key cold email, or submitting an application to that one key role. After all, given the sheer size and rapid growth of the technology industry, it has been and continues to be a \"numbers game.\" Finding a job you love takes a fair amount of dedication, and obliges casting a wide net.\n\nI want to add a caveat here as well. This piece of advice I did not follow _at all_ last summer, and I got extremely lucky to end up at Amazon. I applied to a minimal set of jobs, and instead was bailed out by Greylock and a few \"LeetCode easy's.\" Amazon is a fantastic company, and I am extremely fortunate to be where I am, but without casting a wide net, you'll be left with a lingering \"what if?\" Always try to aim higher; contentment will limit you!\n\nA good way to apply this right away is to cold email your dream companies. For example, I've always wanted to work in the NLP space, and a dream company of mine is [Voiceflow](https://voiceflow.com/). I sent a brief, direct email to the founder, and I heard back! While it didn't lead to a job, I came pretty darn close to a dream role. All from email!\n\n![An e-mail to Braden Ream, the CEO of Voiceflow.](/blog-images/the-rescinded-internship-offer-playbook/002-voiceflow.webp)\n\nThis time around, I am working diligently and systematically to exhaust all possible avenues. Persistence pays dividends in the long run.\n\n\n## 3. Gratitude in all things\n\n\nIn relying on your network's support and applying just about... everywhere, you must lead with gratitude. It is vital to show thanks for those that support you along every step of the journey. I would not be at my current university or in my current job if it weren't for the support of my family, a host of invaluable mentors, and a number of friends over the years encouraging me to keep pushing. It's essential to take time to show thanks; it's the right thing to do!\n\nThat being said, it's often overlooked. In the hustle and bustle of trying to get a job, it is easy to forget the follow-up thanks. Leading with gratitude is key.\n\nHere's an easy way to apply gratitude right away. _Always_ follow up after chats and interviews. Sending a thank-you email is a must-do in my book, and can help you stand out. You can try kick-starting relationships with past mentors as well. It is never too late to rekindle and say thanks.\n\n\n## 4. Builders build\n\n\nIf I could only pick one rule to keep, it'd be this one. The beauty of computer science is that no one can stop you from building. Like really, no one. (OK... maybe like, the FBI. But that's about it.)\n\nLeft without a job, there are countless ways to upskill and get ready for the next round. My favorite is building out 'little apps' (though a fully-fledged start-up is great, too). Participating in hackathons is a great way to get this going. Ask your friends and family what kinds of problems there having, and make little hacks for them. Keep them accessible for others online, and do it [in public](https://swyx.io/learn-in-public). Another good trick for easy adoption is building products for other developers; some good examples are CLI tools and IDE extensions.\n\nThe best experience I had with this was in Summer 2020 participating in an ex-Uber engineer-led program called [\"Summer of Shipping\"](https://summerofshipping.com/). It was an awesome community to helped folks bounce back from a summer with a _ton_ of offers rescinded. I even worked at a start-up idea [weNote](https://wenote.ca/) that I'm hoping to return to this upcoming year!\n\n![My landing page for weNote.](/blog-images/the-rescinded-internship-offer-playbook/003-wenote.webp)\n\nThere's also tons of resources online where you can learn for free, if you need a break from purely creating.\n\nJust remember: the beauty of software is that truly anyone where anywhere can get started today. So don't wait for a FAANG offer to get started; start building today.\n\n\n## In parting\n\n\nThose are the 4 rules that I'll be following while re-recruiting for the fall. Have any you would add? Feel free to give me a shout at [mdemar01@student.ubc.ca](mailto:mdemar01@student.ubc.ca). I'm always happy to chat."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on July 3rd, 2022.\n\nEvery single day, you start out as an empty cup.\n\nHumbling, right?\n\nBeyond your laundry list of personal to-dos, slog of tasks at work, and mountain of messages to which you need to respond, you actually need to focus on just one thing each day. And that's filling your cup.\n\n\n## The inspiration\n\n\nI came across an idea loosely linked to this end product from YouTuber [Ali Abdaal](https://youtube.com/c/aliabdaal). His rather simple, but genius suggestion was to mark a highlight each and every day of your life. \"Mark\" can look differently depending on your routine; my weapon of choice is inscribing an \"H\" beside an item from my bullet journal. In some way, though, you should be tracking your highlights for easy reflection.\n\nHaving a \"highlight\" each day doesn't mean spending every day at a concert, or a sports game, or at the hottest club. Rather, it's something that brings you a bit of needed warmth when life's natural chaos ensues. It can be as simple as a great meal, a brisk walk, or a quick phone call. They're moments that you'd want to capture and put in jar for safe-keeping, but often a quick photo will have to do.\n\n\n## The idea\n\n\nAnd those highlight moments help \"fill your cup.\" (The \"highlight\" idea for me is a bit plain, but I think a visual analogy gets it across better. Maybe that's my inner-teacher speaking.)\n\nNot all cups are created equally, either. After a particularly stressful day or week, I find my cup becomes more of a vat. Other times, I'm a bit more of a teaspoon. Being aware of this ebb and flow though has proven to be a particularly powerful idea when it comes to managing my mental health.\n\nWith the pandemic, we had a bit of a drought. It was hard to stumble across cup-filling-moments, so to speak, and I did not effort to create them when they were most needed. On an empty cup, it's hard to be yourself. Not just in terms of the capitalist-fuelled \"can I reach _Inbox Zero_?\" sense, but spiritually, just 'being' yourself.\n\n\n## A year half-full\n\n\nAnd since we've reached the halfway point of 2022, I figured I'd challenge myself to look back on my favorite cup filling moments from this year so far.\n\n\n### Board games at a bar (January)\n\n\n![Scrabble at Browns, with the fellas.](/blog-images/fill-your-cup/000-scrabble.webp)\n\nI'm a nerd at heart, and after months of Wordle, I had to put my new skills to the test. It turns out only mastering 5-letter words is not all that beneficial when it comes to playing Scrabble at Brown's. Regardless, board games at a bar is definitely an underrated activity.\n\n\n### A moment with some trash (February)\n\n\n![Me n’ my trash!](/blog-images/fill-your-cup/001-garbage-cleanup.webp)\n\nI hadn't planned an event in ages. After a year of mostly typing 60 WPM in front of Visual Studio Code (or Vim, if I'm feeling adventurous), it felt great to organize a beach clean-up on the UBC campus. This is a nice moment I had with some trash, after the event.\n\n\n### Volunteering at Collision Conf 2022 (June)\n\n\n![Volunteering at Collision 2022.](/blog-images/fill-your-cup/002-collision.webp)\n\nAnd last but not least, my favorite recent highlight has to be volunteering at this year's Collision Conf. I still remember dreaming of attending as a first-year student working on my first, rather half-baked start-up idea. Since then, my passion for founding has only grown, and I'll be looking to get to work in this last half of 2022. I'll definitely be back at Collision, though hopefully as a founder rather than a volunteer!\n\n\n## In sum\n\n\nSo, those are my cup filling moments. As I battle of this week's edition of the Sunday Scaries, finally getting back to writing again just might fill my (rather average-sized) cup for today."

I'm grabbing a quick bite at one of UBC's only on-campus sit-down restaurants with a close friend, and a Gmail notification appears on my phone. As soon as I saw \"UBC\" in the subject line, I already knew what it was going to be.\n\nStudents had already been buzzing about it for the past week, and I even [tweeted](https://twitter.com/michaelfromyeg/status/1238500414053429248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) about it. We were _finally_ going online.\n\n> Classes are suspended at the UofA, UofT, McGill, Stanford, Western, UDub, Harvard, and UBC is still open... Pumped to go earn my 2% iClicker participation marks today.\n\n\t—Michael DeMarco (@michaelfromyeg) [March 13, 2020](https://twitter.com/michaelfromyeg/status/1238500414053429248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nTrailing behind the universities I mentioned in my Tweet, all of our classes were going remote starting the following Monday. Even though I had seen it coming, I was still a bit shell shocked. I think everyone had their \"COVID-19 moment\", where it stopped being a headline you read about in the news, and started dictating your way of life. Mine came in a 3-part saga.\n\nFirst, it was [Hacktech](https://hacktech.io/). Over Christmas break, a friend shared that Caltech's hackathon had opened their applications for 2020, and I thought it'd be a neat opportunity. I poured over my application, and with a bit of good fortune, got accepted. I booked my ticket to Pasadena and could hardly contain my excitement. Then, it moved online. Four-hundred dollars down the drain, I was a bit disappointed, but I got some friends together from UBC and ended up actually submitting a [project](https://rapviz.appspot.com/) and earning a finalist distinction. This was a solid silver-lining; my fingers are crossed that I may take part in the event next year.\n\n_More on RapViz: the source code for the project is available_ [_here_](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/rapviz)_. My teammates and I used Flask, React, and the Genius API to put this together. It definitely needs a touch-up, but the code is most of the way there. It also needs to be refactored, splitting apart the API code from the front-end._\n\n![Here’s RapViz.](/blog-images/my-covid-summer/000-rapviz.webp)\n\nSecond, it was, as I mentioned, school. Classes being online turned campus into a ghost town almost overnight. First-years flooded out of residents, clubs scrambled to pivot scheduled events online, and I clung on for dear life in each of my classes, submerged in school work. Within a few weeks, I managed to find a somewhat free weekend, pack my life away into four plastic boxes, and drive back to Edmonton. Over that weekend, I got an email from a software developer at the Government of Canada letting my know the internship I had just interviewed for was being eliminated. It was a bad week, to say the least.\n\nThird, it was [SUNIA](https://sunia.ca/). SUNIA is this week-long summer program I've worked with for nearly three years now. I started off in a generic programming coordinator role, helping make UN-related educational material; in my second year, I led marketing and did a fair amount of graphic design, while also working as our \"CTO\" (I snicker at the title, too); this year, I was working as the staff registrar, and also doing a bit more technology related work. [SUNIA got cancelled.](https://sunia.ca/covid) Again, like my semester moving online, I had seen this coming, but still, it meant my fears about a fully indoors summer and an online fall semester were validated.\n\nI was defeated, but I still wanted to make something of my summer. Being so late in the recruiting year, my outlook was fairly bleak. [Here's](https://notion.so/michaelfromyeg/49058c86c8d44605b65f9637d8f9e8a7?v=3acd8e103476491f833c4d69a39995df) the Notion page where I tracked my applications. Nothing too exciting of note; I had to apply to a ton of start-ups, some unpaid internships, and a lot of, erm, _interesting_ positions, to say the least.\n\n![My Notion job board.](/blog-images/my-covid-summer/001-notion.webp)\n\nThen, I thrice got lucky. The first stroke of luck came in the form of an offer to TA an introductory computer science class. I had TA'd during the second semester of my first-year, and leveraging that, I nabbed a TA position for the first summer term. Being only a 10-hour per week role, I still wanted to do a little more. But, it was a definite start.\n\nI also was able to leverage LinkedIn and find a part-time position with my school's Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department. If I'm honest, I think posting on LinkedIn is mostly a waste of time. There's just too much clutter on the platform; your time would be better spent working in public on GitHub, and tweeting your progress. But again, somehow a post of mine reached a communications lead working with ECE who thought I'd be a good fit for a position they'd just opened. ECE wanted to launch a new website they were working on, but needed help seeing it across the finish line. Their [old website](https://ece.ubc.ca/), built using Drupal, was getting near-impossible to maintain, and they had already made a dent in a new WordPress site. With ECE, I've written a [few](https://ece.ubc.ca/news/202005/ece-capstone-faculty-award-recipients) [blog](https://ece.ubc.ca/news/202006/ece-phd-candidate-awarded-prestigious-microsoft-research-grant) [posts](https://ece.ubc.ca/news/202007/ubc-masc-student-developing-wearable-device-track-heart-and-brain-signals) about research ECE grads are doing, wrote a lot of HTML, CSS, and a bit of PHP for the new WordPress site, maintained some legacy code on Drupal, and done a bit of marketing work. It's been a cool gig. I also wrote a few projects to help me automate tasks at work. [Here's](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/pylink) one, which interprets HTTP status codes into a \"report\", given a list of URLs, and [here's](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/rECEsearch) another, which collects UBC ECE research and formats it in a way which can be uploaded to WordPress.\n\nFinally, there was a _third_ stroke of luck I would never have seen coming. For the past few months, I'd been doing _ish_ contract work with a IoT company called [Artesian Software](https://artesiansoft.com/). I say _ish_ because though I was on board as a developer, there was simply no work to be done. Then, thankfully, around about mid-May, the company signed a contract, and we were off to the races. We've been building a platform to support businesses communicate with customers post-COVID. You can see my handiwork [here](https://shieldscore.com/). I get to work on a modern tech stack, which is a nice change of pace from Drupal: React (and React Native at one point), Node, SCSS, AWS (RDS with PostgreSQL, Dynamo, Cognito), ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, and more. I've worked with the Stripe API, created my first microservice, learned a ton about REST, and even more about React.\n\n![The ShieldScore product.](/blog-images/my-covid-summer/002-artesian.webp)\n\nWanting to write a bit more code, I also joined an online community for hackers looking to replicate the in-person intern experience called [Summer of Shipping](https://summerofshipping.com/), and joined a pre-seed accelerator [program](https://studentstartuplife.com/programs/student-summer-program) from Startup Edmonton, where I've been building [weNote](https://wenote.ca/). I've also participated in a couple of hackathons; at one I wrote [a VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michaelfromyeg.vscode-puzzle) to help you practice interview-style coding problems in your editor, which won me the \"best use of an external API award.\" (Even though I wrote my own API and did some, erm, questionable scraping. Whoops.) It currently has 14 installs, which is pretty cool!\n\n_Quick update for 2022: it now has 127+ installs and 10+ stars on_ [_GitHub_](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/vscode-puzzles)_! Development is still actively continuing; my next planned feature is to support puzzles from Advent of Code._\n\nLooking forward to the fall semester, I'm definitely nervous. Online school is hard. There's no getting around that fact. I'll be moving back to Vancouver, so hopefully cutting down the distance and being at least in the vicinity of campus should help my productivity. I'll also gain a bit of a community to rely on.\n\nBeyond the fall, I also have to hunt down co-op positions for winter and summer 2021. The COVID and post-COVID job market is assuredly a \"buyer's market,\" meaning that employers now have the pick of the litter when it comes to applicants. It's a scary reality, but it's one that's not going away anytime soon. My plan, for now at least, is to keep building projects, keep learning, keep being curious, and to stay vigilant. I'm not going to bother betting on getting lucky with offers again; lightning never strikes twice in the same place."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on August 10th, 2019.\n\n![My high school!](/blog-images/michaels-declassified-school-survival-guide/000-mcnally.webp)\n\nHigh school is complicated in more ways than one. From Degrassi-esque social drama to life-altering career decisions, it can be seriously difficult to maintain your grades. However, there are some simple tricks to ease the learning process and make your education systematic-that is, without all the overhead of figuring how to do this whole school thing. By following these three tips, you'll surely see a boost in your productivity and an ease in your hectic high school life.\n\nFirst, the schedule. Scheduling is no easy task! But nothing will hinder your high school experience more than not even being able to see what's in front of you. Scheduling has a myriad of benefits, from being able to see hectic exams days in advance, giving yourself free-time, and preventing yourself from double booking. One of the most common high school troubles is when teachers schedule numerous projects and exams for the same day. I like to call this \"the slog.\" The easiest way to get out of the slog is to jump out in front of it. You'll be surprised how receptive teachers are if you let them know early on that you won't be able to turn something in; however, teachers will not hesitate to dock you marks if you let them know the day of. All of this comes from scheduling. The easiest way to get started is to use an app like Google Calendar. This allows you to sync from your phone to your computer, and you can catch overlaps in your schedule as soon as they appear. Once you're comfortable with using Google Calendar, try to set a daily time to determine your schedule for the next day or week. This way, your studying time and project work periods can also be booked before they get away from you.\n\nSecond, the strategy. By high school, you likely have a good sense of what style of learner you are. But don't fret about the often exclaimed learner categories—be it \"aural,\" \"visual,\" or \"kinesthetic\"—these terms are often too narrow for most students. Instead, work class-by-class. In math, does it help more to do loads of practice or to do just the difficult questions? In English, do you need to spend more time planning, or are you better off working through your ideas as you write? Explicitly outlining these strategies, analogous to you being your own coach, can help you consciously approach your learning. Be flexible with this though! If a strategy is failing, just like a great coach, switch it up. As long as you're sure of yourself, your learning strategy is more likely to succeed.\n\nLast of all, the life. Though it may be tempting at times, when you're bracing for a scholarship and pushing for a spot at your favoured university, never let school trump your personal endeavors. Always maintain the activities you enjoy to ensure both your mental and physical health through the often tumultuous times. Eat three times a day, and try beginning your mornings with protein-heavy breakfasts. Sugar-rich cereals do little to boost your energy throughout the day, but a morning protein boost can give you that crucial edge.\n\nTrying to maintain these three things-the schedule, the strategy, and the life-is the crux of living your best life in high school. First and foremost, put your best foot forward, with these ambitions and motives in the back of your mind, and you'll be sure to thrive throughout high school."

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on May 6th, 2019.\n\nSome of my readers may know that I recently decided what I'll be doing past high school: studying computer science. This is very exciting as I now feel much more focused and fulfilled. I do find now that it is strange sitting in English classes and the like and trying to stay as motivated as I was. I now know that this subject won't be consequential to my life. However, I still enjoy all of my classes and have loved my school year so far.\n\nSomething I want to touch on in this piece is how I came to that decision. It's a very muggy thing, trying to decide what you're going to do after high school, and there's mounds of questionable advice out there. \"Follow your passion!\" is one quip I hear a lot. This is terrible advice. Your passion alone should not inform what you do, because it might not make sense with a few others things: what you're good at, what the world actually needs, and what you can make money for.\n\nI did a little research, and stumbled across the Japanese concept of ikigai. Of course, I won't explain it perfectly, so I encourage you to check this out on your own, but I'll try my best. Ikigai is a Japanese term for \"a reason for being,\" similar to ‘raison d'etre' and other expressions. In the culture of Okinawa, ikigai is thought of as \"a reason to get up in the morning.\" Seems pretty cool right? So what does it actually look like? Well, I'll start with this venn diagram:\n\n![The Ikigai 4-way venn diagram.](/blog-images/ikigai/000-ikigai.webp)\n\nA four way venn diagram, so maybe not totally clear. Let's try to understanding what's going on. There are four categories, as mentioned. What you love, what you can be paid for, what the world needs, and what you're good at. Each of these intersect to fill different roles in our life: profession, vocation (a side hustle or a \"calling\"), mission, and passion. Now it's clear how passion alone is dangerous: it doesn't factor in money or the world at large. At the center of all of these concepts is harmony: ikigai. There are also cautions surrounding the venn diagram. Let's dissect them.\n\nWithout having what the world needs, we feel \"satisfaction, but a feeling of uselessness.\" In our lives, we need to contribute to something greater, and to feel a higher purpose (regardless of our spirituality). Across from that is where we lack any money behind our work; we have \"delight and fullness, but no wealth.\" Don't get too caught up in money though, there's a minimum you have to maintain to lead a satisfying life, and beyond that money begins to dictate your personality. What that baseline is varies from person-to-person, but try to determine what life you want to lead, and this can inform your salary goals. On the bottom right it reads, \"excitement and complacency, but sense of uncertainty.\" In this example, we haven't taken advantage of our skills. This would create a similar apathy and sadness, as we feel we could achieve something greater. Lastly, to the left from there, it reads: \"comfortable, but a feeling of emptiness.\" We need to have work that we love, otherwise, we dive deep into our work. Your life's achievements need to have a personal element to them to bring you joy!\n\nSo, there you have it: ikigai. A tangible way to think about what you want to do with your life. There are no wrong answers with ikigai, and if you ever feel you are missing something, you're never at a dead end. There are always chances to pick up a new hobby, work with a new organization, or challenge yourself somehow.\n\nOh, and how did I use ikigai to decide my major? I focussed on the intersection between what I was good at, and what I could be paid for. The world needs a lot of things, and there are lots of bright people working towards those things in their careers, so I didn't want that to necessarily inform my major. I'll put a pause on world domination for now. Moreover, I'm the type that loves virtually all of my work, so I didn't find that helpful in deciding. So, I had narrowed it down to what made money. Countless jobs have a salary I would be more than happy with. Some that stuck out included work in academia, STEM-centered jobs, potentially even law. Then I thought about what I was good at. I'm pretty flexible, but at more core I have a few main talents: math, problem-solving, and communicating. Well, a job that fuses that quite well is in computer science, where problems must be solved and presented to consumers!\n\nIf you have any questions about ikigai, you're always welcome to reach out at [~~me@michaeldemar.co~~](mailto:me@michaeldemar.co) michaelfromyeg [at] gmail [dot] com.

So I thought I'd put it to good use and share some of my favorites. Here are ten newsletters to brighten up your dreary inbox.\n\n[The Daily Pnut](https://dailypnut.com/)… _The best newsletter, hands down_\n\nThe Daily Pnut describes itself as a newsletter about world affairs that will \"make you sound marginally more intelligent.\" It's my all-time favorite newsletter. With gripping and poignant articles about current events with a (refreshing) non-American lens, The Daily Pnut captures our rapidly changing world in an enjoyable, daily newsletter. It's a must-subscribe.\n\n[Morning Brew](https://morningbrew.com/)… _Business news I can actually tolerate_\n\nBringing you the latest from \"Wall Street to Silicon Valley,\" the Morning Brew is a great financial newsletter for people less knowledgeable on the jargon, but still curious. It's consistently entertaining and lively. If you're interested in the financial world, the Morning Brew is a great way to stay in-the-know.\n\n[Vox Sentences](https://vox.com/vox-sentences)… _The news, but shorter_\n\nConsuming one news source makes you biased, so why not consume them all? Vox Sentences combines snippets from a variety of organizations (though, you'd be hard-pressed to find a Fox quote), and places them together to create short pieces on current events. Always informative and covers pressing issues.\n\n[Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/)… _Brain Food newsletter_\n\nFarnam Street's \"Brain Food\" newsletter covers a variety of mental models and ways of thinking about the world. For lack of a better term, it's damn cool.\n\n[BetterExplained](https://betterexplained.com/)… _Math explained better_\n\nBetter Explained's monthly newsletter showcases articles from their blog which take difficult concepts from mathematics, economics, and other fields and creates intuitive ways of understanding them. Through analogies and no-brainer explanations, this blog makes even the most rigorous calculus concept comprehensible.\n\n[The Ann Friedman Weekly](https://annfriedman.com/)… _Personal lens_\n\nIn this weekly newsletter Ann Friedman shares what she's been reading, and where she's at in life. It's uniquely personal lens makes this newsletter consistently interesting.\n\n[Noticing](https://kottke.org/newsletter)… _Interesting nuggets from around the web_\n\nNoticing collects cool and quirky nuggets of information from around the web. It's the StumbleUpon of newsletters. I love it.\n\n[Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/)… _Asking the real questions_\n\nA thought-provoking newsletter exploring the bigger questions, with stick figures. Because, how else would you figure out the meaning of life?\n\n[Brain Pickings](https://brainpickings.org/)… _Scratch your noggin' with these reads_\n\nAgain, essentially just a mish mash of really cool stuff. This newsletter is particularly beautifully written as well. Its eloquence only makes it more enticing.\n\n[Exponential View](https://exponentialview.co/)… _A nod to what's next_\n\nWith a specifically-futurist lens, Exponential View takes a glimpse into what the next few decades will hold. (However good or not they may be.)"

      "content": "> 📅 Despite the edited date, this post was actually written and published on July 1st, 2017.\n\n![Hacking away at nwPlus 2019.](/blog-images/all-about-hackathons/000-hackathon.webp)\n\nLast weekend, I participated in my first ever hackathon. HackED 2019 is put on by the Computer Engineering Club at the University of Alberta, and follows a similar format to most hackathons. First, there was an opening ceremony to introduce various sponsors, prizes, and relevant information to the competition. Then, we were released into the wild for twenty-four straight hours to produce a piece of software that did a cool thing. And finally, after all was said and done, us bleary-eyed programmers faced the judges and showed off our product.\n\n_Michael from the future here! We created this very vintage Java application for tracking student grades. If you're bored, feel free to poke around the repository_ [_here_](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/student-gradebook)_. It was my first interaction with Java, Swing, and OOP on a sizeable project._\n\nSo that's the gist: 24 hours, code something cool, try to win. Let's cut to the chase: why should you do it?\n\nFirst reason: to learn. Hackathons are a great place to get started with programming. This was a bit of a surprise to me—many people at a hackathon go out of their way to learn a new technology with their project. At HackED 2019, my friends and I built something in Java, and we were all somewhat familiar. However, most decide to branch out and spend the twenty-four hours learning as much as they code. And it works. Because odds are, at a hacking conference with many, many hackers, someone else is probably already familiar with what you're struggling with. So one call-for-help and bam, the support is there. There is no better place to jump into a new programming language than a hackathon.\n\nSecond reason: to collaborate. Especially as a high school student, we don't often have to code together. We write projects, submit them to our instructor, rinse and repeat. When you work at a hackathon, you have to collaborate on code with your peers. For students of code who are new to this, using Git can having interesting results. Thankfully, at HackED there was a Git workshop so it wasn't a total bust. But having to do it first-hand with your friends is the best way to learn, plain and simple. And if you plan to work on any open source projects, it's a need-to-know skill.\n\nThird reason: to network. There are so many bright, eager minds at these events with people interested in everything from Raspberry Pi to Flask to R, etc. You can learn so much just by striking up a simple conversation. At HackED, I learned a ton about post-secondary options, job options for computer scientists in Edmonton, and more. Hackathons are a great way to meet other folks in the industry.\n\nAll in all, go to a hackathon! You won't regret it. Your programming skills will thank you later.\n\nAs a bonus, here are a couple screenshots of what we built at HackED 2019.\n\n![homepage.png](/blog-images/all-about-hackathons/001-homepage.webp)\n\n![4c5e05e6-a4d6-45c0-bb79-80be3184ced6.png](/blog-images/all-about-hackathons/002-4c5e05e6-a4d6-45c0-bb79-80be3184ced6.webp)\n\n![fc0071fa-fa08-45e6-9881-357275cf772f.png](/blog-images/all-about-hackathons/003-fc0071fa-fa08-45e6-9881-357275cf772f.webp)"
