Super cheap and offers a nice view and intro of the island.\n\nAfter arriving, explore! There's a ton to see and do; check out Kek Lok Si (the largest Buddhist template in Malaysia), street art, monkey beach and turtle beach (in Penang National Park), Penang hill, Little India, Chinatown, and more.\n\nI opted to do the monkey beach hike and got some great food in Little India, before watching the Chinese New Year fireworks.\n\n\n### Day 3\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588387640089-cddb822ecae6?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Sunday, January 22nd\n- Location: Cameron Highlands, Malaysia\n\n- Highlights: Arrive in Cameron Highlands; explore a tea plantation\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)\n\nThis day is pretty chill.

He then checks into his hostel, has food, and explores sites around the city.\n\n\n### Day 2\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620549146396-9024d914cd99?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Saturday, February 4th\n- Location: Yogyakarta, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: I arrive, Borobudur\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=6)\n\nSpend the day in Borobudur and head to Malang.\n\nHere's a [guide to Borobudur](https://trevallog.com/borobudur-temple). The cost is USD ~25, though there is a bundle ticket with Prambanan for USD ~45.\n\nI arrive around 1000, and depart towards the city center. Alternatively, I could depart straight for Borobudur. To head from YIA to the temple, see [this](https://alabackpacker.com/how-to-go-from-yogyakarta-international-airport-yia-to-borobudur-temple) article. I think the plan is to check the DAMRI bus, and if it's available hop on (with maybe a quick grab-and-go meal, or eat at the temple). And if the timing isn't good, head to city center, eat, then leave. With that in mind, the latest arrival at the temple should be ~1330. Spend ~3 hours at the template, before heading back (~1 hour approx.), for arrival around 1800. Eat dinner, and head to the train to get set for Malang.\n\nTrain tickets are booked and available here. Going for KIA in Executive class (on coach 'I'... we'll see if that matters) to Malang.\n\n\n### Day 3\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1432405972618-c60b0225b8f9?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Sunday, February 5th\n- Location: Malang, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Arrive in Malang at 0306, and head to the Tumpak Sewu waterfall\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/malang/208996/daily-weather-forecast/208996?day=7)\n\nArrive in Malang around 0306. Head to the waterfall around 0500 or 0530, via taxi (or some kind of driver). Then arrive at 0700 or 0730.\n\n[Guide to the falls](https://thetravelauthor.com/tumpak-sewu-waterfall-east-java-complete-guide).\n\nAt **the falls,** there are two entrances. We can head to the Lumajang side first, early in the morning, and then down to the falls. Finally, (if we'd like), we can see the Coban side. To get to the bottom, you have to go through a waterfall, so wear waterproof shoes; there's a guide rope to climb down. (This might be too dangerous in wet season.) The west side (Coban Sewu) entrance is dangerous, but the east side (Lumajang) is more safe.\n\nAlso, be aware there are fees are various points, so have cash on hand.\n\nAside: the Lumajang view point is also great for a drone. Professional electronics won't be usable, since it's constantly wet.\n\nIt costs about IDR20,000 to enter, though it can be more.\n\nAfter, we can head to the **Goa Tetes** and explore. This part is a lot more chill. It's near when you begin to enter the base of the falls.\n\nThen we leave, and depart for our hotel at the base of Bromo. The hostel (through our tour with Vincent) is the Café Lava Hostel.\n\nPrice wise, you have the option to do it with a tour or on your own.\n\nOur preference: approximately EUR184 per person (so EUR368 total) to do the tour (as-is; could modify).\n\n_or,_ could book piecemeal\n\n\n- Taxi from Malang to Tumpak Sewu, 48\n- Taxi from Tumpak Sewu to Bromo, ~60 (depends on exact destination)\n\n- Bromo tour, TODO (drop-off in Probolinggo)\n\t- (With the tour this included Madakaripura!)\n\t- Either USD17 and USD60 (maximum) for a jeep rental; plus a trip to Probolinggo (probably), say USD50; and a hostel (say USD20)\n\t- (Or a separate tour?)\n\n\n### Day 4\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605860632725-fa88d0ce7a07?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Monday, February 6th\n- Location: Probolinggo, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Mount Bromo; Mount Ijen (overnight)\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/malang/208996/daily-weather-forecast/208996?day=7)\n\nStart the day _very_ early by doing the Mount Bromo sunrise hike.\n\n[Guide to Mount Bromo](https://themandagies.com/ultimate-guide-to-mount-bromo).\n\nNot too complicated; the tour will do it for us.\n\nAfter, head through to Probolinggo. Our tour will drop us off there.\n\nSpend the day in Probolinggo, before hopping on a train towards Ijen (specifically, Banyuwangi). The station that's best to head to Ijen is ~~Banyuwangi~~ Ketapang (since it's close to Ijen Backpacker, our hostel). There's a train that departs Probolinggo at 1542 and arrives at 1949; this gives us a decent window to check in and sleep, before heading for Ijen.\n\n[Guide to Mount Ijen](https://thetravelauthor.com/mount-ijen-hike-indonesia-a-complete-guide).\n\nFrom our hostel, we can get a ride to Ijen around midnight. See the article for a few tips; our hostel should help us. Biggest thing will be a mask for the mountain; at least pack a bandana.\n\n~~**TODO:**~~ ~~book train from Malang to Probolinggo and book hostel in Ijen; plus maybe the ferry to Bali and the ride from hostel to Ijen. (Plus I will book Bali 2-night hostel; delay for my friend's friend.)~~\n\n\n### Day 5\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555400038-63f5ba517a47?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Tuesday, February 7th\n- Location: Probolinggo, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Mount Ijen (morning); Bali\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/probolinggo/203184/daily-weather-forecast/203184?day=9)\n\nStart the day again, **very early,** atop Mount Ijen. Go from Mount Ijen on the ferry to Bali, and spend the day there.\n\nCan head to ferry via the hostel. Hostel can be the Ijen Backpacker; it's close to Ketapang and the ferry.\n\nCheck out the rice plantations, before my friend heads to the airport.\n\nTanah Lot, Monkey sanctuary, rice plantations.\n\n\n### Day 6\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577717903315-1691ae25ab3f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Wednesday, February 8th\n- Location: Bali, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Nusa Penida snorkeling tour, Uluwatu\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/denpasar/202196/daily-weather-forecast/202196?day=10)\n\nSpend the day in Bali. Head down to Nusa Penida for a bit, grab food and watch the sunset on a beach. Will take some planning later this week.\n\n(Doing a Nusa Penida day trip, ending at Uluwatu, finally will grab back to hostel.)\n\n\n### Day 7\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1436491865332-7a61a109cc05?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Thursday, February 9th\n- Location: Singapore, Singapore\n\n- Highlights: Travel back to Singapore.\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/denpasar/202196/daily-weather-forecast/202196?day=11)\n\nHead to the airport and fly home.\n\n\n## Weather\n\n\nThis travel is during the rainy season. Every day will be very, very rainy.\n\n[Bali Weather & Bali Climate](https://bali.com/bali/weather), from their official website (\"[bali.com](http://bali.com/)\").\n\n\n**NOTE:** Weather can be extreme. Very cold on the top of the mountains, for example, while at other times being, hot, humid, and rainy.\n\n\n## Food\n\n\n(This list if very out-of-date. I'll come back to later.)\n\n\n- ARANG state bar\n- Coconut ice cream\n\n- Balinese Home Cooking\n- R.A.K. coffee\n\n\n## Future\n\n\n\n- Sumatra (see orangutans!)\n- Cities: Jakarta, Surabaya"

(Can do near Bohol.)\n\n\n### Day 3\n\n\n\n- Date: Saturday, March 25th\n- Location: Bohol, Bohol, Philippines\n\n- Highlights: Dive on Bohol (and specifically, Panglao); spend the night\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=7)\n\nA guide to dive sites in [Panglao](https://www.alonaboholdiversclub.com/scuba-diving-areas-in-bohol/dive-sites-in-panglao/).\n\nDive on day 2.\n\n\n### Day 4\n\n\n\n- Date: Sunday, March 26th\n- Location: Oslob, Cebu, Philippines\n\n- Highlights: Depart for Oslob in the morning, chill, then head to Moalboal\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=8)\n\n[Here](https://book.phbus.com/en/travel/panglao/oslob?people=1&date=2023-03-26&direction=forward)'s the link to the ferry. It departs at 6:30am and arrives around 8am.\n\nCan do the whale shark activity. [Here]'s a guide to [Oslob Bay](https://guidetothephilippines.ph/articles/ultimate-guides/oslob-cebu-travel-guide). Here's some [more information](https://sugbo.ph/2022/whale-shark-oslob-cebu-guide/). We may have time after to do a waterfall or something.\n\nTo get to Moalboal, take [the bus](https://cebuvisayantravel.com/how-to-get-to-moalboal-from-oslob/).\n\nSpend the night in Moalboal. Some hostel options: [Chief Mau](https://www.hostelworld.com/pwa/hosteldetails.php/Chief-Mau-Moalboal-Cebu/Moalboal/271767?from=2023-03-22&to=2023-03-23&guests=0), Ananas, Maayong, Hangover.\n\n\n**Revision:** the ferry to Oslob broke down. We'll skip the whale shark watching and head for Moalboal tomorrow.\n\nIdeally, we could take the 6am ferry and cram canyoneering into the same day. Instead, only the ~8am ferry is bookable. Alas, we can still try to make canyoneering. If we don't, head to Moalboal and check out White Sand beach, Lambug beach, snorkel. On **day 2** in Moalboal, do canyoneering and snorkeling _instead_ of diving if we didn't do it on this day.\n\n\n### Day 5\n\n\n\n- Date: Monday, March 27th\n- Location: Moalboal, Cebu, Philippines\n\n- Highlights: Spend the day in Moalboal\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=9)\n\n[Here](https://divehappy.com/diving-moalboal-philippines-a-quick-guide/)'s a guide to diving in Moalboal. For dive centers, emailed Dive Lab ([handuck9@hotmail.com](mailto:handuck9@hotmail.com)), Quo Vadis Dive Resort ([booking@quovadisresort.com](mailto:booking@quovadisresort.com)), Savedra Dive Center ([info@savedra.com](mailto:info@savedra.com)).\n\n[Here's](https://gretastravels.com/sardine-run-moalboal-turtles/) a guide to the sardine run.\n\n\n### Day 6\n\n\n\n- Date: Tuesday, March 28th\n- Location: Moalboal, Cebu, Philippines\n\n- Highlights: Spend another day in Moalboal!\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=10)\n\nConsider canyoneering, others. At Kawasan Falls.\n\nAt night, for Michael to make BKI, we'd have to go back to Cebu City. The flight is at 3am on Wednesday. Ideally back around 12am, so aim to leave Moalboal at 9pm. A bit later is OK.\n\nTODO: transit options? Last bus goes at 6pm. Can try and book through hostel.\n\n(Konstantin should stay an extra day and dive.)\n\n\n### Day 7\n\n\n\n- Date: Wednesday, March 29th\n- Location: Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines\n\n- Highlights: Depart for Kota Kinabalu.\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=11)\n\nDepart for Kota Kinabalu via a connection through Manila.

North part of the island has many good activities, too.\n\n\n### Day 8, 9 (Malaysia)\n\n\nArrive in Kota Kinabalu and join Brian's transfer.

But, I have class on Friday.\n\n\n### Day 2\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1574267005912-d81f712b5a5e?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Saturday, January 21st\n- Location: Penang, Malaysia\n\n- Highlights: Arrive in Penang; spend the day\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)\n\nIf you arrive in Butterworth, you can take the ferry into Georgetown. Super cheap and offers a nice view and intro of the island.\n\nAfter arriving, explore! There's a ton to see and do; check out Kek Lok Si (the largest Buddhist template in Malaysia), street art, monkey beach and turtle beach (in Penang National Park), Penang hill, Little India, Chinatown, and more.\n\nI opted to do the monkey beach hike and got some great food in Little India, before watching the Chinese New Year fireworks.\n\n\n### Day 3\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588387640089-cddb822ecae6?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Sunday, January 22nd\n- Location: Cameron Highlands, Malaysia\n\n- Highlights: Arrive in Cameron Highlands; explore a tea plantation\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)\n\nThis day is pretty chill. Depart for Cameron Highlands in the morning and enjoy the afternoon and evening at Cameron Valley Tea House 1 (or Bharat Tea Plantations Sdn. Bhd).\n\nCome back to Tanah Rata, grab food, and spend the night.\n\nFor the hostel, stay in Hiker's Sleep Port.\n\n\n### Day 4\n\n\n\n- Date: Tuesday, January 24th\n\nTODO\n\n\n### Day 5\n\n\n\n- Date: Wednesday, January 25th\n\nTODO\n\n\n### Day 6\n\n\n\n- Date: Thursday, January 26th\n\nTODO"

Other options: Koh Tao, [Koh Phangan](https://backpackerswanderlust.com/koh-phangan-backpacking).\n\n(Unrelated, but per [this](https://thebrokebackpacker.com/backpacking-thailand) there's some pretty good backpacking just north of Bangkok en route to Chiang Mai; might be able to rope that into my next trip.)\n\nAnother day in P&T Hostel.\n\n\n### Day 6\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584226958444-6a259ba5e202?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Thursday, February 23rd\n- Location: Krabi, Thailand\n\n- Highlights: Head to Krabi; first day in Krabi!\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)\n\nA quick morning in Surat Thani before departing for Krabi.\n\n\n- Wat Tham Suea (Tiger Cave Temple)\n- Khao Khanab Nam Mountains (USD$9.41)\n\n- Au Luk Mangroves (where are these?!)\n- Klong Thom Hot Springs (USD$2.82 for the hot springs, USD$6.27 for the nature reserve)\n\n- Emerald Pool (USD$6.27)\n- Wat Kaew Temple (USD$15.67)\n\n- Elephant Sactuary (USD$78.35...)\n- Thung Teao Forest Natural Pkar (USD$2.82)\n\n- Phra Ae Beach\n- Tonsai Bay\n\nCheck-out of P&T Hostel.\n\nHead to Krabi.\n\nCheck-in to K-Bunk at AoNang.\n\n\n### Day 7\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589211059547-2dc456fd0be0?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Friday, February 24th\n- Location: Krabi, Thailand\n\n- Highlights: The first full day in Krabi.\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)\n\nEnjoy Krabi!\n\nProbably worth doing a day-trip to the Phi Phi islands.

He then checks into his hostel, has food, and explores sites around the city.\n\n\n### Day 2\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620549146396-9024d914cd99?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Saturday, February 4th\n- Location: Yogyakarta, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: I arrive, Borobudur\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=6)\n\nSpend the day in Borobudur and head to Malang.\n\nHere's a [guide to Borobudur](https://trevallog.com/borobudur-temple). The cost is USD ~25, though there is a bundle ticket with Prambanan for USD ~45.\n\nI arrive around 1000, and depart towards the city center. Alternatively, I could depart straight for Borobudur. To head from YIA to the temple, see [this](https://alabackpacker.com/how-to-go-from-yogyakarta-international-airport-yia-to-borobudur-temple) article. I think the plan is to check the DAMRI bus, and if it's available hop on (with maybe a quick grab-and-go meal, or eat at the temple). And if the timing isn't good, head to city center, eat, then leave. With that in mind, the latest arrival at the temple should be ~1330. Spend ~3 hours at the template, before heading back (~1 hour approx.), for arrival around 1800. Eat dinner, and head to the train to get set for Malang.\n\nTrain tickets are booked and available here. Going for KIA in Executive class (on coach 'I'... we'll see if that matters) to Malang.\n\n\n### Day 3\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1432405972618-c60b0225b8f9?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Sunday, February 5th\n- Location: Malang, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Arrive in Malang at 0306, and head to the Tumpak Sewu waterfall\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/malang/208996/daily-weather-forecast/208996?day=7)\n\nArrive in Malang around 0306. Head to the waterfall around 0500 or 0530, via taxi (or some kind of driver). Then arrive at 0700 or 0730.\n\n[Guide to the falls](https://thetravelauthor.com/tumpak-sewu-waterfall-east-java-complete-guide).\n\nAt **the falls,** there are two entrances. We can head to the Lumajang side first, early in the morning, and then down to the falls. Finally, (if we'd like), we can see the Coban side. To get to the bottom, you have to go through a waterfall, so wear waterproof shoes; there's a guide rope to climb down. (This might be too dangerous in wet season.) The west side (Coban Sewu) entrance is dangerous, but the east side (Lumajang) is more safe.\n\nAlso, be aware there are fees are various points, so have cash on hand.\n\nAside: the Lumajang view point is also great for a drone. Professional electronics won't be usable, since it's constantly wet.\n\nIt costs about IDR20,000 to enter, though it can be more.\n\nAfter, we can head to the **Goa Tetes** and explore. This part is a lot more chill. It's near when you begin to enter the base of the falls.\n\nThen we leave, and depart for our hotel at the base of Bromo. The hostel (through our tour with Vincent) is the Café Lava Hostel.\n\nPrice wise, you have the option to do it with a tour or on your own.\n\nOur preference: approximately EUR184 per person (so EUR368 total) to do the tour (as-is; could modify).\n\n_or,_ could book piecemeal\n\n\n- Taxi from Malang to Tumpak Sewu, 48\n- Taxi from Tumpak Sewu to Bromo, ~60 (depends on exact destination)\n\n- Bromo tour, TODO (drop-off in Probolinggo)\n\t- (With the tour this included Madakaripura!)\n\t- Either USD17 and USD60 (maximum) for a jeep rental; plus a trip to Probolinggo (probably), say USD50; and a hostel (say USD20)\n\t- (Or a separate tour?)\n\n\n### Day 4\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605860632725-fa88d0ce7a07?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Monday, February 6th\n- Location: Probolinggo, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Mount Bromo; Mount Ijen (overnight)\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/malang/208996/daily-weather-forecast/208996?day=7)\n\nStart the day _very_ early by doing the Mount Bromo sunrise hike.\n\n[Guide to Mount Bromo](https://themandagies.com/ultimate-guide-to-mount-bromo).\n\nNot too complicated; the tour will do it for us.\n\nAfter, head through to Probolinggo. Our tour will drop us off there.\n\nSpend the day in Probolinggo, before hopping on a train towards Ijen (specifically, Banyuwangi). The station that's best to head to Ijen is ~~Banyuwangi~~ Ketapang (since it's close to Ijen Backpacker, our hostel). There's a train that departs Probolinggo at 1542 and arrives at 1949; this gives us a decent window to check in and sleep, before heading for Ijen.\n\n[Guide to Mount Ijen](https://thetravelauthor.com/mount-ijen-hike-indonesia-a-complete-guide).\n\nFrom our hostel, we can get a ride to Ijen around midnight. See the article for a few tips; our hostel should help us. Biggest thing will be a mask for the mountain; at least pack a bandana.\n\n~~**TODO:**~~ ~~book train from Malang to Probolinggo and book hostel in Ijen; plus maybe the ferry to Bali and the ride from hostel to Ijen. (Plus I will book Bali 2-night hostel; delay for my friend's friend.)~~\n\n\n### Day 5\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555400038-63f5ba517a47?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Tuesday, February 7th\n- Location: Probolinggo, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Mount Ijen (morning); Bali\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/probolinggo/203184/daily-weather-forecast/203184?day=9)\n\nStart the day again, **very early,** atop Mount Ijen. Go from Mount Ijen on the ferry to Bali, and spend the day there.\n\nCan head to ferry via the hostel. Hostel can be the Ijen Backpacker; it's close to Ketapang and the ferry.\n\nCheck out the rice plantations, before my friend heads to the airport.\n\nTanah Lot, Monkey sanctuary, rice plantations.\n\n\n### Day 6\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577717903315-1691ae25ab3f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Wednesday, February 8th\n- Location: Bali, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Nusa Penida snorkeling tour, Uluwatu\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/denpasar/202196/daily-weather-forecast/202196?day=10)\n\nSpend the day in Bali. Head down to Nusa Penida for a bit, grab food and watch the sunset on a beach. Will take some planning later this week.\n\n(Doing a Nusa Penida day trip, ending at Uluwatu, finally will grab back to hostel.)\n\n\n### Day 7\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1436491865332-7a61a109cc05?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Thursday, February 9th\n- Location: Singapore, Singapore\n\n- Highlights: Travel back to Singapore.\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/denpasar/202196/daily-weather-forecast/202196?day=11)\n\nHead to the airport and fly home.\n\n\n## Weather\n\n\nThis travel is during the rainy season. Every day will be very, very rainy.\n\n[Bali Weather & Bali Climate](https://bali.com/bali/weather), from their official website (\"[bali.com](http://bali.com/)\").\n\n\n**NOTE:** Weather can be extreme. Very cold on the top of the mountains, for example, while at other times being, hot, humid, and rainy.\n\n\n## Food\n\n\n(This list if very out-of-date.

(Explore stuff \"to the left.\") Can start in the early evening, catch sunset, then back to work for a bit.\n\nConsider squeezing in the peak on this day, too.\n\nActual: go for nice breakfast at a cafe, work. Can check out HSBC Building (1 Queen's Road), Central-Mid-Levels escalators, ferry area / Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park.\n\nFor dinner, try to do Stanley Market. Can go for sunset. Can go a bit early and catch Rhino Rock as well.\n\n\n### Day 3\n\n\n\n- Date: Wednesday, April 5th\n- Location: Hong Kong\n\n- Highlights: Spend the day with Jacky; horse racing\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=4); mostly hot\n\n\n**On Thursday** do this instead.

Go via cable car (preferable; faster... this is Ngong Ping 360) or ferry (slower; more scenic). See the Tian Tan Buddha, stroll down the Wisdom Path (very cool) to the Po Lin Monastery. Then check out Tai O (a traditional fishing village).\n\n~~Head back to HK, and take the tram up to The Peak. (Or, do Sunset Peak.) Time it for sunset.~~ Go to Stanley market instead, since the weather is poor (no point in peak). If weather is nice, maybe do The Peak.\n\nCan do some work and chill after!\n\nTODO: this day Wednesday instead. Horse racing / Kowloon moved to Thursday.\n\n\n### Day 5\n\n\n\n- Date: Friday, April 7th\n- Location: Hong Kong\n\n- Highlights: A bit more exploring HK; spend the night out\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=6); cloudy, a bit rainy\n\nMight be a good day to do Dragon's Back. Ask hostel if I can leave bag for the day.\n\nLast day in HK. Do laundry early, pack-up, and do some work. Need to be at airport at ~10pm, so can't go out for too long.\n\nArrive in Vietnam ~1am."

But, I have class on Friday.\n\n\n### Day 2\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1574267005912-d81f712b5a5e?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Saturday, January 21st\n- Location: Penang, Malaysia\n\n- Highlights: Arrive in Penang; spend the day\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)\n\nIf you arrive in Butterworth, you can take the ferry into Georgetown. Super cheap and offers a nice view and intro of the island.\n\nAfter arriving, explore! There's a ton to see and do; check out Kek Lok Si (the largest Buddhist template in Malaysia), street art, monkey beach and turtle beach (in Penang National Park), Penang hill, Little India, Chinatown, and more.\n\nI opted to do the monkey beach hike and got some great food in Little India, before watching the Chinese New Year fireworks.\n\n\n### Day 3\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588387640089-cddb822ecae6?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Sunday, January 22nd\n- Location: Cameron Highlands, Malaysia\n\n- Highlights: Arrive in Cameron Highlands; explore a tea plantation\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=5)\n\nThis day is pretty chill. Depart for Cameron Highlands in the morning and enjoy the afternoon and evening at Cameron Valley Tea House 1 (or Bharat Tea Plantations Sdn. Bhd).\n\nCome back to Tanah Rata, grab food, and spend the night.\n\nFor the hostel, stay in Hiker's Sleep Port.\n\n\n### Day 4\n\n\n\n- Date: Tuesday, January 24th\n\nTODO\n\n\n### Day 5\n\n\n\n- Date: Wednesday, January 25th\n\nTODO\n\n\n### Day 6\n\n\n\n- Date: Thursday, January 26th\n\nTODO"

He then checks into his hostel, has food, and explores sites around the city.\n\n\n### Day 2\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620549146396-9024d914cd99?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Saturday, February 4th\n- Location: Yogyakarta, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: I arrive, Borobudur\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/yogyakarta/211671/daily-weather-forecast/211671?day=6)\n\nSpend the day in Borobudur and head to Malang.\n\nHere's a [guide to Borobudur](https://trevallog.com/borobudur-temple). The cost is USD ~25, though there is a bundle ticket with Prambanan for USD ~45.\n\nI arrive around 1000, and depart towards the city center. Alternatively, I could depart straight for Borobudur. To head from YIA to the temple, see [this](https://alabackpacker.com/how-to-go-from-yogyakarta-international-airport-yia-to-borobudur-temple) article. I think the plan is to check the DAMRI bus, and if it's available hop on (with maybe a quick grab-and-go meal, or eat at the temple). And if the timing isn't good, head to city center, eat, then leave. With that in mind, the latest arrival at the temple should be ~1330. Spend ~3 hours at the template, before heading back (~1 hour approx.), for arrival around 1800. Eat dinner, and head to the train to get set for Malang.\n\nTrain tickets are booked and available here. Going for KIA in Executive class (on coach 'I'... we'll see if that matters) to Malang.\n\n\n### Day 3\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1432405972618-c60b0225b8f9?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Sunday, February 5th\n- Location: Malang, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Arrive in Malang at 0306, and head to the Tumpak Sewu waterfall\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/malang/208996/daily-weather-forecast/208996?day=7)\n\nArrive in Malang around 0306. Head to the waterfall around 0500 or 0530, via taxi (or some kind of driver). Then arrive at 0700 or 0730.\n\n[Guide to the falls](https://thetravelauthor.com/tumpak-sewu-waterfall-east-java-complete-guide).\n\nAt **the falls,** there are two entrances. We can head to the Lumajang side first, early in the morning, and then down to the falls. Finally, (if we'd like), we can see the Coban side. To get to the bottom, you have to go through a waterfall, so wear waterproof shoes; there's a guide rope to climb down. (This might be too dangerous in wet season.) The west side (Coban Sewu) entrance is dangerous, but the east side (Lumajang) is more safe.\n\nAlso, be aware there are fees are various points, so have cash on hand.\n\nAside: the Lumajang view point is also great for a drone. Professional electronics won't be usable, since it's constantly wet.\n\nIt costs about IDR20,000 to enter, though it can be more.\n\nAfter, we can head to the **Goa Tetes** and explore. This part is a lot more chill. It's near when you begin to enter the base of the falls.\n\nThen we leave, and depart for our hotel at the base of Bromo. The hostel (through our tour with Vincent) is the Café Lava Hostel.\n\nPrice wise, you have the option to do it with a tour or on your own.\n\nOur preference: approximately EUR184 per person (so EUR368 total) to do the tour (as-is; could modify).\n\n_or,_ could book piecemeal\n\n\n- Taxi from Malang to Tumpak Sewu, 48\n- Taxi from Tumpak Sewu to Bromo, ~60 (depends on exact destination)\n\n- Bromo tour, TODO (drop-off in Probolinggo)\n\t- (With the tour this included Madakaripura!)\n\t- Either USD17 and USD60 (maximum) for a jeep rental; plus a trip to Probolinggo (probably), say USD50; and a hostel (say USD20)\n\t- (Or a separate tour?)\n\n\n### Day 4\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605860632725-fa88d0ce7a07?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Monday, February 6th\n- Location: Probolinggo, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Mount Bromo; Mount Ijen (overnight)\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/malang/208996/daily-weather-forecast/208996?day=7)\n\nStart the day _very_ early by doing the Mount Bromo sunrise hike.\n\n[Guide to Mount Bromo](https://themandagies.com/ultimate-guide-to-mount-bromo).\n\nNot too complicated; the tour will do it for us.\n\nAfter, head through to Probolinggo. Our tour will drop us off there.\n\nSpend the day in Probolinggo, before hopping on a train towards Ijen (specifically, Banyuwangi). The station that's best to head to Ijen is ~~Banyuwangi~~ Ketapang (since it's close to Ijen Backpacker, our hostel). There's a train that departs Probolinggo at 1542 and arrives at 1949; this gives us a decent window to check in and sleep, before heading for Ijen.\n\n[Guide to Mount Ijen](https://thetravelauthor.com/mount-ijen-hike-indonesia-a-complete-guide).\n\nFrom our hostel, we can get a ride to Ijen around midnight. See the article for a few tips; our hostel should help us. Biggest thing will be a mask for the mountain; at least pack a bandana.\n\n~~**TODO:**~~ ~~book train from Malang to Probolinggo and book hostel in Ijen; plus maybe the ferry to Bali and the ride from hostel to Ijen. (Plus I will book Bali 2-night hostel; delay for my friend's friend.)~~\n\n\n### Day 5\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555400038-63f5ba517a47?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Tuesday, February 7th\n- Location: Probolinggo, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Mount Ijen (morning); Bali\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/probolinggo/203184/daily-weather-forecast/203184?day=9)\n\nStart the day again, **very early,** atop Mount Ijen. Go from Mount Ijen on the ferry to Bali, and spend the day there.\n\nCan head to ferry via the hostel. Hostel can be the Ijen Backpacker; it's close to Ketapang and the ferry.\n\nCheck out the rice plantations, before my friend heads to the airport.\n\nTanah Lot, Monkey sanctuary, rice plantations.\n\n\n### Day 6\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1577717903315-1691ae25ab3f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Wednesday, February 8th\n- Location: Bali, Indonesia\n\n- Highlights: Nusa Penida snorkeling tour, Uluwatu\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/denpasar/202196/daily-weather-forecast/202196?day=10)\n\nSpend the day in Bali. Head down to Nusa Penida for a bit, grab food and watch the sunset on a beach. Will take some planning later this week.\n\n(Doing a Nusa Penida day trip, ending at Uluwatu, finally will grab back to hostel.)\n\n\n### Day 7\n\n\n![image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1436491865332-7a61a109cc05?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb)\n\n\n- Date: Thursday, February 9th\n- Location: Singapore, Singapore\n\n- Highlights: Travel back to Singapore.\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/id/denpasar/202196/daily-weather-forecast/202196?day=11)\n\nHead to the airport and fly home.\n\n\n## Weather\n\n\nThis travel is during the rainy season. Every day will be very, very rainy.\n\n[Bali Weather & Bali Climate](https://bali.com/bali/weather), from their official website (\"[bali.com](http://bali.com/)\").\n\n\n**NOTE:** Weather can be extreme.

Go via cable car (preferable; faster... this is Ngong Ping 360) or ferry (slower; more scenic). See the Tian Tan Buddha, stroll down the Wisdom Path (very cool) to the Po Lin Monastery. Then check out Tai O (a traditional fishing village).\n\n~~Head back to HK, and take the tram up to The Peak. (Or, do Sunset Peak.) Time it for sunset.~~ Go to Stanley market instead, since the weather is poor (no point in peak). If weather is nice, maybe do The Peak.\n\nCan do some work and chill after!\n\nTODO: this day Wednesday instead.
